         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are like vnto that kinde of people, who hauing bene led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue into ſome farre countrey when they were yong, haue not onely loſt their time, but haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alſo both their countrey, naturall language, and the amitie of their own kindred. For, we are no ſooner out of our cradle and ſwadling cloutes as it were, but that our peruerſe and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affections ſurprize vs, as a man would ſay, like violent windes, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſayles of our deſires, with a thouſand delicat gales, make vs migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely degenerate from our owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination, driuing vs therby from all true and right reaſon. For, let our ſoule continue neuer ſo litle a while in this baniſhment, ſhe by and by forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her originall being, leeſeth the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:132013:4"/> remembrance of her principall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and good, and in the end, which is a farre greater miſchiefe, ſhe forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth likewiſe the knowledge of her ſelf. Now then there remaineth nothing why we are not altogether like vnto theſe miſerable captiues. For, if they after their long captiuitie, haue neuer ſo little hope of their returne, or do but heare their countrie ſpoken of, a man ſhall perceiue their hearts to leape with ioye in their bodies, ſo greatly doth this kinde of newes pleaſe and like them. But contrariwiſe, we vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly miſlike thoſe men, who labour to call vs home againe vnto the place where we had our firſt being, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre nothing more then when we ſee them marke out vnto vs the ready way to come thereto. Theſe men will leaue the fortunate Iſlands, and returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Ithaque,</hi> ſet faſt like a neaſt built vpon the very top of a ſharpe ſteepie rocke. And we will not onely leaue the mire and dirte wherein we ſit faſt mortrized, rather then we would poſſeſſe and enioy moſt aſſured and euerlaſting felicitie. Now, ſome man may peraduenture ſay vnto me,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132013:4"/> I beſeech you Sir, where is that felicity which you talke of? ſhew it vnto vs, for that is it that we deſire: for what man is he that would refuſe to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and bleſſed? Alas my good friends, I know that the worde liketh you well: but without doubt yee flie from the thing it ſelfe: or at leaſt, yee follow naught elſe but the ſhadow, and leaue the bodie flying from you, and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a vaine cloude of delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the true, ſound and incomparable pleaſure. Where then is it, ſay you? ſhew vnto vs the way and tract, that we may ſpeedely take hold thereof. Shall I tell you my good friends one thing, and that is this, would it not thinke you, make you laugh to ſee a pore or ſand blinded man come vnto <hi>Pylon,</hi> a moſt excellent counterfeitor in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and importune him to ſhew him his pictures and exquiſite paintings, or to ſee a deaffe man preſſe in to heare the ſweet muſicke and hermonie of <hi>Bayf</hi> a moſt excellent muſition, would not the firſt man ſay, vnto the ſand blinded man, go thy way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue firſt from thee that running hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which is the cauſe of the dimming
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132013:5"/> of thy ſight, &amp; vnto the other, go thou and drie vp the catarre which is the occaſion of thy deafeneſſe, and then thou that art blindiſh, ſhalt ſee our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paintings, and thou that art deaffiſh ſhalt heare our delicate and pleaſant ſongs? For, as the pleaſure of the ſences cannot be well taſted nor reliſhed, but by ſuch as haue whole and ſound bodies, no more can the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and delight of the minde, wherein reſteth our chiefe felicitie, be perceiued by any, but by ſuch, as haue cleanſed their ſoules of all ſinfull and corrupt luſts, which as filthie botches and blaines extinguiſh the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in that part of the body wherein they are engendred. Heere then you ſee what you muſt do, if you determine to make your ſelues capable to taſte of the fruits of this euerlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I right well know, that ye are ſo brought vp, euen from your youth, in the pleaſures of your ſences, and make ſo much of them, as that you are afeard yee ſhall loſe them, without I leaue this as a pawne vnto you, which will bring vnto you farre more infinite greater pleaſure, and wherewith I will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132013:5"/> feaſt you, and quickly ſhew it you. But who is able to make men, that are no better then duſt and aſhes, to ſee the eſtate and diſpoſition of a pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſoule, whoſe action is perfectly bleſſed, and altogether heauenly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth this moſt excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation? In very deed, you preſſe me too too ſore, and craue at my hands more then I am able to do. But becauſe I am loth to diſcourage you, and make you mal-content, I wil do for you what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I am able. And I will deale with you, as the carriers about of monſters do: For, they ſet vp their pictures at the corners of the ſtreets, and hang out the portraitures of them at their owne lodgings, and when the people haue paid their money at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the gate, then they ſhew them their naturall and liuely bodies. Now, the ſight which I inuite you to ſee, is this <hi>VViſedome,</hi> which we may rightly ſay, to be the very truth and knowledge of all things, but eſpecially of heauenly things, which is full of vnſpeakeable cleereneſſe, brightneſſe, and ſplendure, and which alſo, if we might behold face to face, and in her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132013:6"/> naturall excellencie, would rauiſh vs with her loue, and cauſe vs hate theſe baſe and earthly things, with the loue of which we are ſo farre ſotted, euen to our very deſtruction. I will heere hand vp, as it were, vpon the beaten high waies, pictures and images, ſo that if ye be diſpoſed to go right on to the gate, yee ſhall ſee both the image and the emboſting of them: which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt moſt maruellous, and when you haue paid your cuſtome, and paſſed the borders and limits of this life, you ſhal ſee that, which no tongue is able to vtter, nor eare able to heare. But to make you acknowledge at length what this is, and plainly to prick out vnto you ſome draughts hereof, I beſeech you conſider euen of the things which you ſo wonder at heere in this world, and ſo greedely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly labour for, and hunt after, and you ſhall finde, that if you go onely ſtep by ſtep on them, and follow ſtill your way, that they will at laſt bring you vnto the knowledge of that which you at this day deſire. But becauſe that in ſtead of going on them, you ſettle your ſelues, and ſit faſt down vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132013:6"/> on them, you your ſelues become moſt vile and filthie by them. Now, let vs ſee a little why you thus ſatiſfie your ſences, and from whence this pleaſure and tickling delight ſpringeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you eſtabliſh the ſeat of your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicitie. Commeth this from the obiect of naturall things, that are growne vnto perfection? Are theſe the well mingled, ſorted, and ſetled colours, and the exactly obſerued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions and dimenſions, which thus pleaſe the eyes? What other thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire you in a medow, ennameled with a thouſand goodly and odoriferous floures, and ſo richly in diuerſe places, with ſundrie colours bedecked? What other thing admire you in the ſtately buildings of kings, in their Bracelets, Chaines, and other Iewels, and in the Tables of moſt excellent Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but onely this curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Yea what other eſtimation make you of the moſt faire ſweete faces of women, with whom yee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminately burne in loue, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall proportion, and exact diligence of nature, in the conformitie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of many things differing one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132013:7"/> from another? What other thing is the ſweetneſſe of one eſpeciall voice of a man, or the melodie of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in conſort, but a iuſt and orderly continuation of them all together, or ſuddaine motion of many voices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a naturall rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the ſame? And what other thing is the moſt pleaſant and ſweete ſauour that a man can poſſiblie ſmell, but a certaine temperature both of heate and moiſture, and a certaine qualitie imprinted in a bodie, by the ſuddaine motion of one or many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Neither is any thing ſweet and pleaſant in the moſt delicate meates and ſauoures, but a certaine meaſure of well mixed licoures. Neither doth the touching of them bring or yeeld any other pleaſure, but a certaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and length which we finde in naturall bodies. Now marke then all the pleaſures which your ſences can poſſibly receiue: yee conſume the whole time of your life, onely about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for, for them alone, ye wearie your bodies with continuall toiling &amp; moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and for them alone, yee ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the winds, and croſſe the ſeas.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132013:7"/> If then yee finde that all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things do poſſeſſe your minds by a certaine vaine ſhew of beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, what will yee then ſay, when as yee ſhall conſider of them all at once, and at one view, euen from their firſt beginning, vnto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of their perfection? Shall yee not ſee the ſelfe and the ſame difference betweene them, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one ſtone alone, and an whole proude and coſtlie Pallace, and betweene one voice, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet and full noiſe of muſick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one finger, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die? What matter can you make of all theſe particular things, eſpecially of theſe earthly things, when as in lifting vp your eyes towards the Sunne and Starres, yee behold the world, from the higheſt part of heauen, to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the earth, euen from the beginning of the ſame vnto the end thereof, and conſider, how many wonderfull things are depainted and ſet foorth on euery ſide? If ſo be then, we haue done it to feed and ſatiſfie our ſences onely, with the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of theſe beautifull and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132013:8"/> things, it muſt needs be that we haue done it at the leaſt by reaſon of the whole workmanſhip and frame of the ſame, the elegancie whereof conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the accordance and aſſembly of all the other particular beauties &amp; ornaments thereof. But our ſoule, which lancheth and ſtretcheth forth her deſires and wiſhes farre aboue the reach of our ſences, without we will violently captiuate, choake and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her, hath no deſire to ſtay heere. For ſhe findeth nothing heere, which can any way retaine, or yet containe her. But ſhe is more honourable then ſo, for ſhe embraceth heauen and earth, compaſſeth all the whole world, pierceth the bottomleſſe depths, knoweth all things, and beſtirreth and manageth her ſelfe, and is ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that if we conſerue her in her naturall excellencie, all the reſt of the things of the world, in reſpect of her, will ſeeme to be moſt filthie and oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. After ſhe hath beheld her ſelfe, and exerciſed her ſelfe about the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out of cauſes and ſciences, finding nothing in all this, no not any thing in her ſelfe, that liketh her
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132013:8"/> ſelfe, and reſting her ſelfe in a deſire which ſhe hath to learne, ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to lift vp her ſelfe farre aboue the world, yea and farre aboue her ſelfe, and ſuffereth her ſelfe to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the workes of the worke-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And there ſhe ſeeth all at once, all ſorts of beauties and perfections, abutting and aſſembling themſelues euen from their very firſt originall, and by ſo much the more they appeare moſt excellent and wonderfull, by how much the nearer they come from thence from whence they firſt came. Altogether like vnto the Sunne beames, which, the nearer they are the bodie from whence they ſhoote and ſpred themſelues, the greater, the purer, and the brighter they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. I vſe eſpecially in this behalfe this compariſon, becauſe that of all things which we know heere below, nothing more proportionably agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with our ſoule, then our ſight, which is the moſt noble, liuely, &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt action of all our ſences, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more proportionable vnto God then the light, which is the moſt pure and moſt excellent thing in the world.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132013:9"/> And the ancient wiſe men haue ſaid, That the light was Gods bodie, and the truth his ſoule, repreſenting, ſhewing, and giuing vs a taſte as it were, heereby, of one of the greateſt ſecrets of the Godhead. We muſt therefore open and vnſeele the eyes of our minde, that we may pearſe into this heauenly light, euen vnto the depth of the euerlaſting truth. If we will neuer ſo little helpe our ſelues, and lift vp our ſoule, that ſhe may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by thoſe ſteppes, which offer themſelues vnto her, and hoiſe vp her ſaile on hie, what delight and pleaſure might ſhe not hope for, but wiſh, not wiſh for, but ſay, not ſay, but thinke, which we enioy not in full meaſure? yea ſuch pleaſure as that we ſhould feele encreaſe and redouble in vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time that being aſcended vnto the feaſt, we ſhould be ioined vnto that firſt and moſt high light.

There ſhall we ſee the beames of this Deity ſpread all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and reunite it ſelfe vnto this body of light, whereunto, when we ſhall ſee our ſelues conioyned in thought, we ſhall then perceiue at once all the cauſes and effects of the eternall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which particularly, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably may ſeeme to be able to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with matter to our great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Here then we ſee wherein conſiſteth our felicitie, that is to ſay,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:132013:10"/> in this vndriable ſpring-head of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in this deepe ſea of all bounties, whereinto all the riuers &amp; ſtreames of the world muſt run. That is to ſay, into this original light, vnto whom we muſt turne our ſelues, and vpon whome we muſt faſt fixe and ſet the eyes of our ſoules, if ſo be we loue the eternall bleſſedneſſe. Alas, how excellent was this laſt ſigh of the Philoſopher <hi>Plotin,</hi> who hauing now his ſoule geuing vp her ſelfe betweene his lips, called his ſchollers vnto him, giuing them this farewell. My good friends, God graunt you to liue, both now, and hereafter, in bliſſe for euer, and alwayes turne that godlineſſe that is in you, vnto that auncient &amp; principall Deitie. O noble ſpeech, and worthie the cloſing vp of the mouth and life of a Philoſopher! But what ſhall we do for the returning of our ſelues vnto God, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, reunite, and become one with him? Shall we preſent our ſelues vnto his maieſtie in that eſtate wherein we commonly ſtand? No ſurely, for if we, before ſuch time as we lift vp the eyes of our ſoules towards this cleere and bright burning light, do not wipe, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132013:10"/> cleanſe our ſelues, we ſhall, in ſtead of enioying this glorious and pure light, haue that little ſight that we haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly put out. For, as in the lawe of the lewes, the woman that offred her ſelfe vnto the triall of the ielouſie offering, receiued no hurt by the bitter &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed water if ſhe were chaſt and ſound, but was quit and free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all blame &amp; ſuſpicion: and contrariwiſe, if ſhe had broken her mariage promiſe &amp; faith, remained infected, and ſo rotted and burſt in ſunder: euen ſo alſo thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who, as the members of the Church of God, haue maried his only Sonne, if they offer themſelues poluted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed to touch the holy fier of his holy ſpirit, are rather blinded, then enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, yea rather conſumed, then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And this is the reaſon why God, when as he, hauing compaſſion of our ruine &amp; fall, is willing for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to diſcloſe vnto the world this light of wiſedom, he ſendeth his herault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to waſh &amp; make cleane the ſoules of all ſuch as he would haue behold the brightnes of his glory. We heare euery where the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the holy voice of this Prophet, crying, <hi>Make ſtraight &amp; plaine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132013:11"/> the wayes of the liuing God, repent, and bring forth the fruites worthy of repentance, for he will come with his fanne in his hand to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now the Corne from the Chaffe, lay vp the Corne by itſelfe, and caſt the Chaffe into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting fier.</hi> Seeing then that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this great felicitie, and that before we preſent our ſelues vnto him, we muſt cleanſe our harts and minds, and make them capable to conceiue of heauenly things, let vs ſee what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we haue for that purpoſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, let vs ſomewhat alittle before, conſider, how and in what ſort we haue ſo defiled our ſelues, that we might thereby the more eaſily finde out the meeteſt meanes to cleanſe our ſelues: and let vs ſee from whence and which way we are fallen, that thereby we may perceiue by what meanes we may be able to lift vp our ſelues againe. For, God ſaw nothing amongſt all his workes which any thing drew neare vnto his perfection: and therefore he himſelf was then deſirous to mould and faſhion a liuing image of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which ſhould be his chiefe and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall worke, and ſet him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the world. Whereupon, man
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:132013:11"/> forthwith ſhewed himſelfe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the earth ſo perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, as that nothing could be wiſhed to be more excellently perfect. For, he being made a liuely image, and being alſo as it were but a ſhort and halfe picture, hauing withall, many the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments both of the aire, and of the grace of the principall ſubiect or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was moſt wonderfully perfect. The holy fier which God had breathed into him, being very pure, enlightened his vnderſtanding, and filled him with the knowledge of all things, in ſo much, that he hauing truth for his guide, and vertue for his ayde, all his actions paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the compaſſe of reaſon: and turning him ſelfe continually vnto his Creator, receiued to himſelfe as in a very cleere looking glaſſe, the forme and faſhion of the Deitie: in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of whome, he fixed and ſtayed all his thoughts, and thereby became very bleſſed, for he liued in God, and God in him. But when as this mirror which was beautified and adorned with the obiect of the Deitie, would needs runne him ſelfe amongſt the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous ſtormes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132013:12"/> thereby defile and ſully him ſelfe, then this immortall brightneſſe diſdained any more to ſhew himſelfe vnto him, and left him altogether to remaine in darkeneſſe &amp; obſcuritie. So that man, before ſuch time as he had turned his back vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, being filled with a moſt ſure knowledge of all things, is now as it were become brutiſhed, and in ſtead of truth, is full of error and lying: and in ſtead of a ruled and moderate will, is now full of burning luſt, ſo as all his thoughts which before were reunited to the beholding of his creator, haue now ſpread themſelues ouer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; roame about at all adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures without either guide or reaſon. This concupiſcence and luſt then hauing thus proſtituted her ſelfe, forthwith conceiued ſin, which comming to a ful growth, amended death. And death in deed, brought forth the extremitie of al euils, and death I ſay, the hope of all horror and obſcuritie, wherein, all the while that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſwadled &amp; wrapped, was neuer ſince euer able to receiue the brightnes of the immortal light, ne yet attaine againe vnto the conduct of the truth, the only beholding wherof is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132013:12"/> able to keepe him backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to the point of his felicitie. When man ſaw himſelfe thus defaced, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with himſelfe, &amp; curſed his life as a gulfe of miſerie, where he ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before his eyes but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion and darkeneſſe. And all his animaduerſions were nothing but of euils, and all his hope of nothing but of calamities. For, God being nothing but righteous, and man, nothing elſe but ſinne, what meaſure or end could there be of his puniſhment? Howbeit, the eternall wiſedome who wrought with God in the creation of man, hauing compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the loſſe &amp; deſtruction of ſuch a worke, came, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayth, to lay a ſteepe the poiſon of death in his own blood, to waſh &amp; cleanſe vs, &amp; beſides, to turne away the iuſt wrath of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might haue mercy vpon vs, and ſo turne vnto vs againe. Thus we ſee how we are entred againe into grace with our God, purified by his mercie, called againe vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth, and the beholding of his glorie. Howbeit, we are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe &amp; obſtinate in our curſedneſſe, &amp; ſo great enemies to our owne felicitie,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132013:13"/> as that ſo ſoone as this eternall light would begin to appeare and ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the cleareneſſe of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there to expreſſe and reimprint the face of his Deitie, and relieue and recharge the lineaments of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome, which are ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defiled, and as it were vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, as that we make a thouſand foule blemiſhes rebound vpon our ſelues, which blind and defile vs, and thruſt them ſelues betweene vs, and the grace which ſhould enlighten vs. We muſt therefore as often as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our ſelues, ſo often alſo lay too our hands to wipe away our foule and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſtaines, for the cleanſing and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our ſoules, ſo that we thereby being poliſhed, the beames of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall bountie and goodneſſe may cauſe the cleareneſſe of vertue and truth moſt clearely ſhine, and brightly burne vpon vs. Here then we ſee the meanes which we herein muſt hold and keepe: let vs now looke what the cauſe of this euill is, and then let vs alſo wiſely conſider of the remedie for the ſame. In very deede, our peruerſe and corrupt iudgement, is the very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132013:13"/> fountaine of all our offences, and the ſpring-head of that peſtilent humor, which ſo infecteth and ſpoyleth vs. The things which ſpoyle and trouble vs, are the delightes and pleaſures which on euery ſide alure vs, and make vs drunke before we are fully awake. This licour then being mixed amongſt our tender ſenſes, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of our age, ſo delicately ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, as that we can neuer after loſe and forget the ſauour thereof. We content not our ſelues with moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinking, but we will be ouer head and eares alſo, tarrying ſtill by it as if we would haue the tide ouerflowe vs, leauing our ſelues drowned as it were vpon the ſwallowing quickſand of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable old age. Now theſe ſweet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours wherewith we ſo fill and glut our ſelues, turne by and by into bitternes, and fill our harts and minds with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous humor, which infecteth and corrupteth vs. For, the affection which we beare vnto the beauty of theſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things, being entertained and flattered by vs, changeth it ſelfe into a furious and mad luſt, which peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ouerthroweth our ſentes: for,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132013:14"/> the flattering and diſſembling deſire which we haue vnto theſe worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, turneth it ſelfe into a blinde and ſenſleſſe paſſion, and are none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be eſteemed in this world, but as the ordure and excrement of the earth: and the loue of falſe honor conuerteth it ſelfe into a fooliſh deſire to be farre more then the reſt of the world, and chalengeth vnto it ſelfe the reuerence and ſeruice that is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himſelfe. The pleaſure which we take in our feeding, is turned into beaſtly and ſhameleſſe gluttony: The care that we take in preſeruing our bodies delicately, groweth into beaſtly vncleanneſſe, and filthy luſt, and the worthineſſe that we beleeue too too much of our own courage and valure, turneth it ſelfe into outragious choler and raſhneſſe. And ſurely, our minds being ſtopped and oppreſſed with ſo foule and ſlimie humors, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer breathe forth any thing that is pure and cleane. Now, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all theſe ſubtile and mortall paſſions, and poyſons of the minde, we muſt ſee what remedie we can finde out for them, and it may be,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132013:14"/> it will be to good purpoſe to vſe the counſell which a good auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue vnto a religious nouice of his houſe. Like as wiſe nurſes (ſayd he) when they will weane their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will rub the neble of their teate with wormewood, and other bitter druggs, euen ſo muſt we be dealt withall for the making of vs loſe the taſte of our delightes and pleaſures, for wee muſt ſet downe vnto our ſelues a certaine puniſhment for our luſts, and change the houres of our pleaſures into rigorous and auſtere exerciſes, and at that time we are wonted to take our fooliſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute recreations, let vs examine with all humilitie, what paynes and torments our ſinfull and deteſtable life deſerueth. I cannot tell whether this good old Father in ſpeaking this, thought vpon the cuſtome which the Hebrewes vſed, who made a ſolemne feaſt vpon that day that they began to weane any of their children, or whether they reioyced in that their children left their weaker foode, and fell to more ſtrong and mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, it is no reaſon that we moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and filthie wretches that we are, ſhould ſeeke out of our ſelues the matter for which we ſhould be angrie and grieued with our ſelues. For, our conſciences do commonly tell vs, and continually repreſent vnto vs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of vs, the regiſter of our ſinnes: agreeing with that of <hi>Democritus</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That hee heard the voyce of malice and ſinne accuſing her ſelfe. Ouer and beſides all this, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtice, or the fatherly care of God, continually ſheweth vnto vs his rods, ſometimes ſtriking vs with them, to make vs awake, and leape out of this miſerable, filthie, and dittie puddle. But if nothing will cauſe vs to hate our ſelues, and deteſt our miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life, let vs conſider with our ſelues, and thinke of this hideous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible image of death, vnto whome our ſinne hath deliuered vs vp. For, death followeth vs hard at our heeles both by ſea and land, he embarketh himſelf with vs, and rideth on horſebacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde vs, and leaueth vs nothing ſaue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132013:17"/> only our ſhadow. We do nothing elſe all our life long but flye from him, and yet we are ſtill neerer and neerer him. It is he that in a moment cutteth off the thread of our deſires, and he, who vppon the ſuddaine, bereaueth vs of all that we haue ſcraped together with great paine, and in the end ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our ſelues away cleane out of the world. Seeing then that his image is pictured out to be ſo feareful in all the corners of our life, let it be a bridle to reſtraine our filthy luſts, and let vs ſtep backe when we ſee ſuch a bottomleſſe deapth lye wide open before vs. But if we haue ſo engaged and bound our ſelues before hand, as that we cannot goe backe, yet he at leaſt forewarneth vs of the danger, and let vs forſake this vile and heauie burden of baggage, that we may the lightlier leape, and luſtelier skip ouer this dangerous breake-necke, and leape into that goodly and flouriſhing playne, which we ſee to be on the other ſide, which is that euerlaſting life that we all waite for. Howbeit, if the remembrance of this temporall and corporall death cannot poſſibly wither and dry vp our

Surely we are much like vnto thoſe ſailers which turn their backs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where they meane to go aſhore. We make a ſhew as thogh we would eſchue this death, &amp; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of our liues, we run vnto it with open mouth. Let vs therefore looke wiſhly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this death, and on as many other rocks as we muſt ſayle and flote by in this voyage, that we may feare. And let vs conſider, that we are now ſo wounded and bruſed, as that if an eſpeciall fauour from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſaue vs not, we ſhall be hardly able to auoyd ſhipwracke. This is the contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhould be in our ſouls, &amp; this is that bitter repentance which ſhoulde drawe bloudie teares euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the bottome of our bowels.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132013:19"/> This is it that ſhould make vs hate eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n our own ſelues for the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciling of vs vnto our God, &amp; to renue our life of ſin and wickednes, into puritie and cleanneſſe. This is it that ſhould cauſe vs to enter into iudgement with our ſelues, that we might not be reſerued vnto the day of that moſt heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For what man is he that is able at that day to iuſtifie himſelfe? Now, it is not enough that we haue had this compunction and repentance in our harts, but we muſt alſo lay open our ſinnes, and the iuſtice of God, that we might receiue from him his mercy and comfort. And it is he that muſt accept of our ſorrow and griefe, and he, vnto whome we muſt make an honorable amends, and ſimply and plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our errors. For, ſeeing it is his pleaſure, that his goodnes which he is able to keepe and reſerue vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould be poured out vpon all his creatures, and that he hath made all things to manifeſt his glorie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the vſe of our life only to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, neither are we any way able to repare the offence which we commit againſt him, by the corrupting of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132013:19"/> vſe of our life, but in manifeſting that he hath created vs to do good, &amp; that we our ſelues haue conuerted our ſelues only to do ill. And therefore we muſt of neceſſitie vndoubtedly declare that he is liberall, &amp; we moſt vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we muſt ſay, that he is good, &amp; our ſelues to be moſt wicked, we muſt alſo pronounce his righteouſneſſe, and our ſinne, we muſt ſet forth our own griefs and his mercy, we muſt proteſt that all the euill which is in vs, commeth of our ſelues, and all the good which we hope after, to proceed from him alone. For, if ſo be we ſhall be ſilent, after that we haue once acknowledged our euill, it is to be belieued that we will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere with this ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all the daies of our life paſt, and ſo approue by this ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that we cannot freely be found fault withall. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> exhorting vs vnto this confeſſion, telleth vs, that we do not confeſſe our ſelues vnto God, as if he knew not our ſinnes before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but becauſe confeſſion is a counſel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſatisfaction, and maketh vs apt vnto reconciliation, and reconciliation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mercy, and mercy vnto euerlaſting life. Now, the ſatisfaction which we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132013:20"/> looke for, commeth from his fauour and grace, by which only we muſt, and may be reſtored vnto immortalitie, and this grace is not geuen vnto any, but vnto ſuch as acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be miſerable ſinners, and not geuen by any, but by him that is chiefe in power. It muſt needs therefore be, that the word which he hath beſtowed vpon vs to glorifie him withall, muſt be employed to the manifeſtation of our miſery, becauſe the confeſſion of our ſinnes, iuſtifieth the goodnes of God, which we haue as much as in vs lieth vtterly peruerted. We muſt therefore pray vnto him to forgiue vs, as if we ſhould ſay, that he may and ought to puniſh vs, and ſo thereby teſtifie his power and righteouſnes. For this cauſe it is why the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth vs, when as he ſayth, <hi>Goe your waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132013:20"/> the firſt that haue ſinned, ſo alſo we are the firſt that do repent. Howbeit, there remaineth in vs a fooliſh ſhame, which abideth with vs as the skarre of ſinne, and cauſeth vs the ſlowlier and hardlier to do it. This was the cauſe why the auntient Fathers in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſelues vnto this our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and vnto the weakeneſſe of ſuch alſo which might be offended in the reciting ſometimes of very ſtrange ſinnes of ours, were contented that we ſhould put downe and poure out the ſecrets of our conſciences into the boſoms of thoſe vnto whome they had geuen power to binde and loſe, and apply vnto vs the grace by which we are redeemed. And from this miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie we receiue a maruelous fruite, when as it is worthely adminiſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For firſt, he that is appointed to the diſpenſation of this grace, being made vnto vs the father of the ſpirit, is to bring the ſame vnto vs for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the miſtery which he findeth in vs by the trial of our life, euen the very ſelfe ſame affection which a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the behalfe of his very ſick ſon, vnto whom he bringeth beſides help &amp;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132013:21"/> remedy, the hope of health, wherewith he feedeth him. For he ſhould in the fellow feeling of our miſery, and taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the burden of our ſins, help to relieue vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we faint in the middeſt of our courſe. This example which God hath ſet before vs, who (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayth) came himſelfe firſt, <hi>and hath layd vpon his owne backe all our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and borne vpon his ſhoulders all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi> After he hath thus imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs this comfort, he is to direct vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of truth, and with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word of God, wherin he is exerciſed, to till the faith which he hath ſowed in vs, which, by reaſon of the barrenneſſe of the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is caſt, had always neede to haue the help and care of the husbandman. For we are properly like vnto a ſmall. Boate, which is forcibly rowed with ores againſt the ſtreame: but if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen neuer ſo litle leaue rowing, ſhe fleeteth back more in an hour, then ſhe did in a whole dayes rowing. The end and conſummation of this holy action is this, that when we call vpon the holy Ghoſt, our grace is pronounced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and confirmed as it were by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132013:21"/> the iudgement of the church, which is a certaine pawne and teſtimonie, that as we are heere in this world kept fine and cleane by him or them vpon whom ſuch graces are beſtowed, ſo ſhould we alſo be in the other, by him, vpon whom he hath appointed them. There reſteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing after this, but that we humble our ſelues in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace which we haue receiued, a thing that we hardly can obtaine at our own hands. Now we will not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtick to admire at this, but we will neuer follow the example of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which at that time vſed this holy repentance. Yee ſhould haue ſeene of theſe men, ſaith this <hi>Tertullian,</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the feete of the Aulters, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſackcloth and aſhes, bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bitterly their ſinnes, and wringing the mercie of God from him. But theſe are remedies which we neuer ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but by maine compulſion: for the ſhame which we haue of dooing theſe good things, rebateth and ſtrangleth whatſoeuer good thing we are any way forward in. And it is great pittie, that that which neither the voice of the holy Ghoſt, the counſell of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132013:22"/> nor the example of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is able to draw vs vnto, the wrath and vengeance of God will bring vs vnto, manger our heads. In very deed we put on ſackcloth, but we do it when we can no longer tarrie: we caſt aſhes on our heads, but we do it hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, before ſuch time as the wrath of God commeth, which findeth vs out. And we creepe and lowre vnder the Aulters, but it is becauſe we would flie from his hand that purſueth vs. O rebellious and curſed ſeruants that we are! for we neuer reuerence our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>deth his ſcourge ouer vs to correct vs, and we neuer cry him mercie vntill ſuch time as the ſword is readie to cut our throtes. And therfore we muſt ſo humble our ſelues before him, as that we thruſt not from vs, by vaine &amp; preſumptuous thoughts, the grace, by which we are cleanſed and purified. Now, when we ſhall haue thus gathered as it were into our hands the ſinnes, which are the briars and brambles of our ſoules, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the field of our conſciences with teares, and ſoftened and made them tender by this manner of dealing, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:132013:22"/> driuen away the cloudes which did ſo ouer-ſhadow vs, and that the Sunne of the grace of God, ſhall begin to ſhine vpon vs and warme vs, we muſt then heerevpon ſowe ſuch ſeed as may in the end bring forth for his fruite, an heauenly and immortall life. And this ſeed is our will, which as it bloometh either well or ill, euen ſo bringeth it forth either good or bad deedes. Now this argueth well with the meaning of <hi>Theages</hi> the Pythagoriſt: for he ſaith; That this will was as it were the hand of our ſoule, wherewith ſhe turneth all things either vnto good or ill: which is the very ſelfe ſame that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs; <hi>That God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made man, and left him in the hand of his owne counſell, he ſet fier and water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he might beare them in which hand he would:</hi> Which was the thing that might addreſſe this will vnto good, and this is the ſound reaſon, which is the rule that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things vnto that end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto God hath created them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man might the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that it was eaſier for him to doo good, then to doo ill, and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132013:23"/> he hung not alwaies vpon any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full determination, and beſides the naturall light, which he had giuer vnto him, he gaue him alſo his law to preſerue him, if he would keepe it, and to as many of vs as liue in his faith. And beſides his law and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs his grace, which ſo long as we keepe it, maketh vs to do nothing but that which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his commandements, and conſequently with all good reaſon. Now, this rule of well dooing, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in ſharpe witted propoſitions, full of ſubtiltie and ſophiſticall defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and concluſions: for the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of which, a man had need to haue a whole world. For all this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſteth in theſe two points, <hi>To loue God with all thine heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for the making of the way more plaine, and to lead vs as it were by the hand into our workes, we haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine precepts to examine, and put to euery of them, by our actions, and to finde the meanes, wherein the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that which we would do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. This goodly ſeemlineſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132013:23"/> diſpoſition of the minde, being there placed, we call vertue. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe changeth and taketh her particular name according to euery action wherein ſhe ſheweth her ſelfe, it ſhall ſerue to good purpoſe, as I thinke, for the matter that we haue in hand, to ſalute by the way as we paſſe, the eſpeciall ſorts, out of which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth her ſelfe ofteneſt vnto our ſight. The Philoſophers beganne to teach, that vertue was a perſwading to greatneſſe of courage, and an embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening vnto generoſitie &amp; valure. But my deſire is to follow the diſcipline of thoſe whoſe liues and conuerſations, I would gladly follow. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iewe, ſpeaking of the religious men diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout the deſerts of Egipt, and who in great perfection of life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their time in contemplation, ſaith; That they laid vp in their ſoules <hi>Temperance,</hi> as a good, firme, and ſure foundation, whereon they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſettle and eſtabliſh all manner of vertues: and therefore we muſt begin at that end. For, if <hi>Plato</hi> with ſome reaſon compareth our ſoules vnto hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which muſt be ridden and broken
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132013:24"/> ken by a skilfull rider, for a cunning horſeman, will firſt of all be ſure to haue the Bitte in the horſe mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he giue him the ſpurre, that he might reſtraine him from going out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his liſts, and thereby be able both to manage and turne him euenly, and not ſuffer him to beat himſelfe and fling and leape at all aduentures. We call this temperance, the authoritie and power which reaſon ought to haue vpon the luſts and violent affections which carrie our will vnto pleaſures and delights. This then muſt be the reine as it were vnto our ſoules, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue vs as a fit inſtrument, to ſcum the boiling deſires which ariſe in our ſoules, by reaſon of the heat of bloud, that they might be alwaies ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and egalled vnto reaſon, wher vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they muſt be proportionable, not regarding nor yeelding themſelues vnto the ſenſible obiects, which offer themſelues vnto them. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe ſo to yeeld vnto them, as that they cauſe thoſe obiects to ſerue them and reaſon, whereof, they ſhould be altogether in very deed made. Now, of all the paſſions ouer which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132013:24"/> temperance muſt haue an eſpeciall eye, to arrange theſe vnto reaſon, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie concupiſcence, is the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, which tieth vs vnto the luſt of the fleſh, making vs to ſeeke out, in the coniunction ordeined by God, not the bleſſing of a long and happie poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſubſtitute in our ſteads, ſeruants vnto our creator, but a beaſtly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and infamous delight, which blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our ſoules, and maketh our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites drunke. God hauing heaped in man ſo many ſundrie perfections, meant yet notwithſtanding as it were to finiſh the ſame, and did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him that, which is the moſt wonderfull in all the deitie, which was, the making him a creator like vnto himſelfe. For as he created the world that his power might be ſeene &amp; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before him, his wiſedom in his works, ſo alſo would he, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould beget another, one like vnto himſelfe, that he might ſee alſo himſelfe in his owne worke, and loue and cheriſh that which came of himſelfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gaue him a wife, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with him in this workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Nay, he did more then this,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132013:25"/> for his meaning was, that man, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And let vs take great heed that we make not our members filthy ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels, and ſo defile the Temple of God (ſeeing he vouchſafeth to dwell in vs) by the impure dealing with thoſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:132013:25"/> kind of women, who in violating their bodies, violate alſo therewith all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lawes. For, firſt they breake the law of God, who commaundeth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie: the law of nature, which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to make that common, which is borne for one alone: the law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hath brought in marriages: and the law of families, vniuſtly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the labour and trauell of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vnto a ſtrange heire. Truly, from this abhominable and vnbrideled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, come, and are deriued as from a liuely and pleaſant Fountaine, all publike and particular calamities as it were. For when this fooliſh loue is once formed in our ſoules, which being nouriſhed with belly-cheere and idleneſſe, beginneth there to grow and encreaſe, and hath as heady wine run through our vaines, it by and by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our ſences a ſleepe, and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our members, bereaueth our reaſon, and ſo furiouſly reigning ouer vs, carrieth vs away violently into moſt furious purpoſes and practiſes. Do we not ſee at this day the mightieſt king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to be by it digged downe as it were with Pickaxes, and Empires to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132013:26"/> ſtumble and fall downe to ruine. And do we not ſee that it deuoureth in one day the ritches and conqueſts of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worlds? That it openeth the gate to all iniuſtice? Hath it not brought ielowſie betweene brethren, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels betweene Fathers and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? But the worſt and fouleſt of all the effects that it hath wrought, is, the vncertaintie that it bringeth into the minds of kinſmen and families. For, in defiling the mariage bed, it taketh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the children the loue of their father, which cannot be conſerued but by the good opinion that the husband hath of the chaſtitie of his wife, &amp; it breaketh alſo the pietie of the children towards their fathers, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be founded but vpon the ſelf &amp; ſame conſide ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now, when theſe bonds of affection &amp; good will are loſt amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how can they conteine themſelues within any ciuill amity and ſociety? how can they ioyne &amp; vnite themſelues together, to ſerue God &amp; obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements? This ſinne, as an ancient father ſaith, is the deuils hauen, which floting &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vs through voluptuouſnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rebloweth the bellowes of our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132013:26"/> ſences with new hoat deſires, which ſet our ſoules on fire, &amp; there nouriſheth them with ſmoake, taking from them both ſight &amp; iudgement, which ſhould guide them to euery good thing. And therfore how far ſoeuer we can ſee this fooliſh loue, we muſt hunt it away, and deteſt it, as the very poiſon of our ſouls. Howbeit we, contrariwiſe, call it vnto vs, and make much of it, how farre ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be from vs. For we inuite it to giue it reward, and the rewards of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor are for none but for his officers, &amp; all the moſt fine and rare wits take the greateſt delight to impe his feathers, that he might the ſpeedelier and more contentedly come flying into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Princes. Now, a Chriſtian man eſpecially ſuch a one as would attaine vnto this bleſſed conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whervnto we prepare him, will bereaue his ſoule of all theſe filthy luſts, &amp; vſing himſelfe vnto this continuall contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor himſelf, if he poſſibly can, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this treaſure of virginity, wherein lieth a great purity of the mind &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of vnderſtanding: &amp; they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſerue the ſame, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelues with the ſpirit of God.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132013:27"/> which gaue S. <hi>Ierome</hi> occaſion to ſay according to <hi>Varro;</hi> That the reward of virginity was diuination: becauſe that diuination is nothing els but the knowledge of the truth to come, which we attaine vnto by communicating with God, that, which we neuer can obtaine, except we keepe our ſelues pure from all earthly and beaſtly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. So as (as we haue before ſaid) if that our infirmitie ſurmounteth our diſcourſe, we may make our intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance lawfull &amp; excuſable, in rightly vſing the remedie which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto our infirmitie, and ſo be like vnto thoſe firſt Chriſtians of whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid; That they were not borne men, but for ther wiues. Let vs therefore with reuerence enter into this ſocietie of marriage, and let it be a coniunction both of the ſpirit and will, a communion both of faith and religion, wherein nothing is proper ne yer particular, no not ſo much as the very ſecret thoughts themſelues. This is, as <hi>Themiſtius</hi> the Platoniſt ſaid, a full mixture of all together, as wine and water, which being once mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, can neuer be ſeperated againe.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132013:27"/> Heereby we ſee wherein the principall effect of this Temperance ſhould reſt. To ſtirre vp men vnto ſobrietie, and deteſt infamous foule gluttonie, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy delicacie of meates and drinkes, neither is vertue thereby any whit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, but through bond ſlaues and tranſgreſſours; for ſuch luſts very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome grow in an honeſt mind. Such luſts are very ſeldome found in the minds of wiſemen. Although the ages heeretofore haue borne and brought foorth monſtrous <hi>Sardanapales,</hi> who made their bellies their God. The common cry of the people themſelues deteſt them, and are ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the voice of the multitude, although wiſdom ſhould no way deale with them about the matter. It is very true, that when ſuch ſpirits are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with great cheere, they can neuer talke of any thing that is either honeſt or yet godly, which ſhould make them capable of that contemplation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we call them. Now, when as <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribeth out vnto vs the liues of theſe good religious Egyptians, he therein noteth out vnto vs ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſobriety, as that it is impoſſible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132013:28"/> for bodies which kept ſuch a diet could any way hinder the beautifull actions of their ſoule. And therefore let vs vſe meates, and ſuch other like tranſitorie good things, for the ſtrengthening and vpholding of the infirmitie of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the neceſſary inſtrument of the ſpirit. But we muſt not ſo deale with our bodies as men deale with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the magnificence of Princes, which are ſo ſtiffened with embrodery and Goldſmithes worke, and ſo beſet with Pearles &amp; precious ſtones, as that a man can ſcarſly ſtir himſelfe when they are on his back: but we muſt make vs ſuch a garment as muſt ſerue for euery day, and take ſuch a fold as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to giue it. There is alſo another thing which hindreth our ſoules no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe paſſions wherof we haue already ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that is choler, which to ſpeake truly, is the faireſt flower of follie: and that is that paſſion which blindeth vs all at once, when as it hath once taken hold of vs, &amp; maketh things appeare vnto vs, as it were through a clowd, cleane otherwiſe then in deed they are, &amp; is ſo much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a gueſt, by how much the more

For as <hi>Tyndare</hi> ſaith, God himſelf hath no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer that that is paſt, but to forget, and ſo they are for the moſt part, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to repent them of that at leiſure, which in their haſt they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Howbeit, for the repreſſing of this furious haſt, we muſt frame a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirit, which we call <hi>Clemency,</hi> by which, our wils being vnaduiſedly prickt forward to wiſh euill to another, and the deſire of reuenge are reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; repreſſed, when as we ſhall haue this <hi>clemency</hi> rightly framed in vs, by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:132013:29"/> perfect obſeruation of our maners, ſhe will temper vs with ſuch a milde and gratious behauiour, as ſhall defend our reaſon from ſuch a tedious and ſtrong impreſſion as choller is. She will make vs take leiſure to iudge of things by weight and meaſure, to counſell our friends therunto, and diſſwade vs from beleeuing and truſting too much to our owne ſelues. Wherefore ſhe will infinitely ſerue vs to perſwade our ſelues, that we cannot be offended but with our ſelues, neither yet once keepe in our breſts thoſe iniuries which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done vnto vs. For, if our actions be pure and ſound, and our life holy and innocent, can our venimous and hatefull tongue change it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our neighbour? And if we at any time propound vnto our ſelues to liue to the good liking of any one man, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall we be able to find the meanes to pleaſe all the world, and content both good and bad together? if we iuſtifie vs before God and our ſelues, &amp; haue cleane and vndefiled conſciences, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall then do vs hurt. Thou wouldeſt hurt me in my good name, and thinkeſt by falſly accuſing me of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132013:29"/> my life, greatly to wrong me: and I haue God, men, and mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to teſtifie againſt thee, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and iuſtifie me. Thou maieſt haue a will to hurt me, howbeit I need not feele it without I will. Thou takeſt and carrieſt away my goods from me, all this inooueth me not: or the time was that I had none, or I had them when I was ſo yong, as that I knew not what to do with them: and laſtly, although thou haddeſt left them vnto me, yet carried I not them with me when I dyed: and I muſt either leaue them, or elſe they muſt leaue me. And why ſhould I be more ſorie for the one then for the other? Well thou greeueſt me in my body, thou beateſt and hurteſt me, and behold the Souldier which returneth very ioyfully from the skirmiſh, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his arme in a ſcarfe, maketh more account of his wound, then he doth of his life, if ſo be he bring from thence a great gaſh, either in his head or in his face, the more he beholdeth himſelfe, the more he wondereth at himſelfe: If he come home with the ſtring halt of one of his legges, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a ſtep, but he reioyceth that he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132013:30"/> was ſo gloriouſly marked. Wherefore they are not our wounds that do ſo greeue and trouble vs, but the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the which we receiue them, &amp; they bring vs either honor or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, neither is any thing eſteemed for the thing it ſelfe, but for the end why we do it.

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:132013:30"/> therefore if thou wilt be a king ouer thy ſelfe, forgiue thy ſelfe freely: for the glory of a Chriſtian conſiſteth chiefly in this loue, by which he bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his neighbour to loue him, and to be voide of this worldly deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which as a worme gnaweth the hart of thoſe which are infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, toſſeth &amp; turmoileth them all the day, and keepeth them waking all the night. And therefore the ſpirit will compoſe it ſelfe with this equalitie, as that it will not ſuffer it ſelfe to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with hatred and euill will. And from thence will enſue another excellent diſpoſition of the ſoule, which is modeſty &amp; moderation, which bringeth with it a certaine comlineſſe vnto all the actions of the body, and is a teſtimonie by them of gentleneſſe &amp; goodwill, &amp; vertue, which can do more then all the reſt, to make vs ſociable, &amp; to get vs the friendſhip of thoſe with whom either our nature, good hap, or choiſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioineth vs. This gratious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſo agreeable vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as nothing more, for ſhe wringeth out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which force is no way able to do: for ſhe deſireth no ſuperiority ouer the reſt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132013:31"/> but according to reaſon, which is a kind of weapon that will cut deeper then either yron or ſteele. But theſe proud, frowning and ſcornefull people, which looke at all the world ouer their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are therwith ſwolne ſo full as their skinnes can hold, and looke at their tailes like vnto proud Peacocks, do reaſon great wrong, when as they ſo do, clothing him with ſuch talke as vtterly diſgraceth him, and maketh him odious. And beleeue me, it is a very hard thing for theſe men to come any thing neere this holy Philoſophie or wiſedome, which dwelleth amongſt the graces that garde and enuiron her on euery ſide. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue vs learne, how greatly mildneſſe and ſimplicitie ſerue vs to prepare our ſelues to receiue the gifts and perfections of the holy Ghoſt, ſaith preciſely, that he appeareth ofteneſt in the ſhape of a Doue, to ſhew vnto vs that he dwelleth not but in ſuch as are without gall as a Doue is, but are very gratious and gentle. Now, becauſe that for the moſt part it commeth by reaſon of our infirmitie, as thinking to fly one ſinne, we fall into another, we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132013:31"/> are to feare, that becauſe we are not well confirmed in vertue, thinking to hold vs in humilitie, we fall to become very cowards, when as in deed we ſhould rather fall to banding &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. And therefore it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that we adde vnto that which we haue ſpoken, of temperance and mildneſſe, certaine conſiderations to raiſe vs vp to be moſt couragious, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it ſhall ſtand vs in hand to be ſo. Which wil principally ſerue vs, to keep vs in a ſtraite and an aſſured courſe, againſt all whatſoeuer ſhall offer it ſelf to amaze and turne vs from obeying the commandements of God. For, firſt we ſhall on the one ſide haue raſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to egge vs forward to deſire more, then that wherevnto God hath called vs, and oppoſe our ſelues vnto his conſtant and firme purpoſe. Our happie ſucceſſes, and proſperous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters or accidents, will ſo tickle vs, as that they will make vs laugh, our good hap will promiſe vs high and great things, and yet for all this, we will not once change our viſage nor countenance. We will ſcornefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and looke vpon, and that with a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132013:32"/> leering eye, the preſents of fortune (if I may ſo ſay) like vnto the faire &amp; freſh coloured Apples, which grew neere to the lake of <hi>Ghomorre,</hi> but they were no ſooner touched, but that they fel forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into powder and aſhes. But if reaſon telleth vs that we muſt take them, we will then vſe them with great equalitie of minde, and facilitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and make none other eſtimation of them. On the other ſide, we ſhall haue afflictions, dangers, griefes, and pouertie, which in the iudgement of the common people, wrappeth vp all manner of miſeries. And it is againſt theſe enemies chieflie that this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue muſt boiſterouſlie ſtretch forth her armes: It is through them that ſhe muſt make way, if ſhe meane to come to the end of her purpoſe. Howbeit if we our ſelues ſtand in no feare, and ſhe not before ſuch time as we ſee the enemie, what miſchiefe may they do vs? Forſooth, they will ſpoile vs of all our goods, and ſo we ſhall go the lighter: ſeeing then that the reward is reſerued for him that commeth firſt, and ſhall the longer while enioy the immortall goddes which ſooneſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132013:32"/> commeth thether, ſhall we then feare to loſe the baggage, for the obtaining of ſuch a glorious victorie? And now behold the breach is made, and our Captaine within that calleth vs, and we our ſelues buſie our ſelues to ſhoote at him that arreſteth vs by the cloake, and put our ſelues in hazard to remaine priſoners in the hands of the enemie, that will cauſe vs loſe both cloake and honour, and the fruite alſo of all our trauell. We are threatned with death, and what other thing elſe is it that we ſeeke after? We haue not clothed our ſelues with this tranſitorie and mortall life, but onely to pay the tribute, and diſcharge the tolle at the comming in of euerlaſting life. Theſe are good newes, ſeeing we are called vpon to pay, for it is a token that we are come on ſhore. But what is this death that thus terrifieth vs? What? is he ſo to be feared, as that he will make vs turne our backs vpon him, &amp; forſake the field of vertue, &amp; lie ſlily hid in the trenches, or rather in the ſand holes of ſlouthfulneſſe and cowardiſe? If we thinke it an euill thing, it is becauſe we feele it to be ſo, or elſe becauſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132013:33"/> others thinke ſo of it. Haue we not heard the plaint of thoſe who haue couragiouſly died, either for the honor of God, or els for the ſeruice of their king, or for the defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? Was there euer yet any nation ſo barbarous, ſo voide of humanitie, or as we commonly ſay, ſo farre from the ſunne, as that commend not with great praiſe, the valure and worthineſſe of thoſe that haue ſpent their liues for the common-wealths ſake? Hath not the memorie of poſteritie, taken them out of their graues, to make them aliue againe in the remembrance of men? And if we ſhould come to number out the parts of the life of man, ſhall we recken the time which they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in eating, drinking, and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or rather principally bring into a ſhort accoumpt, the dayes wherein they haue moſt valiantly fought for vertue? And therefore that which we call life, is but a death, becauſe it dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without leauing any memory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for, that which we call death, is in very deed life, becauſe it is that which maketh vs to be &amp; continue for euer. Neither are we to regard how long we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132013:33"/> liue, but how wel we liue: neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth death too ſoone if he bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with him, neither is it for the only opinion of another, and for the honor which we ſhall get by well dying, that ought to make vs contemne death, but for the loue of that ſecond life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we muſt enter. The <hi>Druydes,</hi> had ſome forefeeling of the immortalitie of our ſoules, which cauſed them to be more valiant then all the people of the world: for, they made a skorne to ſaue their liues, ſaying, that they made no more accoumpt of them, then of the head of a willow tree. And the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who made a ieſt at them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed yet, that they held a bleſſed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Howbeit, we ſay, that their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was bleſſed, by taſting of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, whereby they found groping in the darke, the very reſting place of felicitie, and had found out the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſon, which driueth away and ſlayeth feare, the very poyſon of our ſoules, which drieth vp, and feeb liſheth our hearts and minds. But we, being brought vp and taught in a better Schoole then they were, do not only know, but conſtantly beleeue, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:132013:34"/> only beleeue, but are glad alſo as a man would ſay, of this ſecond immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life. For, we haue a ſpirit lodging in the inward part of our ſoule, which ſayeth and ſoundeth continually, if ſo be we will heare it, nothing elſe but this life to come. And vnto this voyce it is, that ſo many millions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue in the middeſt of their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and torments, followed the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard or enſigne of their Captaine, ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſheading their bloud in all the corners of the earth, as the true and pure ſeed of faith. This is that Trompet which hath encouraged them to fight this combat, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they haue returned very bloudy, but yet haue bene triumphant, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victorers. If ambitious honor dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs vnto moſt ſtrange hazards of warre, if this affection, to be eſteemed and honored of thoſe before whome wee liue, haſtneth and kindleth the courſe of our actions, what greater hope is there of theſe which haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned this? for they haue not onely bene honored whilſt they liued, but wee alſo reuerence theyr aſhes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead, theyr bones are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132013:34"/> holie vnto vs: the memorie of their liues is yeerely renued with deuout commemorations and prayers: wee honor them in our verie thoughtes, wee humble our cogitations before them, as placed in a great degree of honor in the Church of God, and as hauing found grace before the face of our Lorde and God. And therefore wee muſt not bee voyde of courage for the effectuall brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to paſſe of good and holie things, ſeeing that the verie wicked them ſelues, are the better part of theyr dayes ſo valiant in executing theſe wicked and moſt deteſtable things. For with this patience and ſtrength of courage, muſt wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter triumphing into the kingdome of glorie, wee hauing bene told by <hi>Toby</hi> this goodly and holy Oracle, <hi>That hee O Lord which ſerueth thee with all his heart, if his life be put in hazard, ſhall bee without doubt crowned.</hi> And for this cauſe it is why the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth vs, that this good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beeing brought into miſerable captiuitie &amp; thraldome, did neuer for all that forſake the voyce of the truth.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132013:35"/> And to ſay truly, we can no way iuſtly attribute vnto our ſelues the name of Chriſtians, if we reiect and forſake the Croſſe which is left vnto vs in ſtead of all other maner of weapons, and is the very ſample &amp; paterne that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath geuen vs, to make vs vnderſtand when we ſhall come vnto him, and the watchword that witneſſeth vnto vs that we are his. For, we haue no means that can make vs perceiue that we are inſtructed in his diſcipline, but by this patience, the very mother of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> alſo ſayth, That the Martyres run vnto torments as vnto the ſchoole &amp; exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. It now followeth that we ſee how we ſhould behaue and carry our ſelues in the diſpoſing of the benefits which it pleaſeth God to beſtow vpon vs. In very deede, the rule which hereof is ſet before vs, and the habit which we take vpon vs to vſe them well, is called <hi>Liberalitie.</hi> Now, the firſt precept which we are to learne, is to acknowledge, that all the benefits which we haue, we hold of the goodnes &amp; grace of God: the ordinary exerciſe whereof, is to do good vnto all the world, and to ſpread
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132013:35"/> vpon vs his bleſſings, albeit we no whit deſerue them. And the reaſon why he ſo bountifully deſtributeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, is not to the end we ſhould locke them vp, and let the gole and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mould, which are no way good nor profitable but when they are well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but to the end that as he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated vs vnto his owne image, ſo alſo we ſhould imitate him, in well doing vnto our neighbour, according to our abilities. And truly we haue farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to do it then he. For, that which he geueth is his owne, and he geueth it to ſuch alſo, as be no way able to do him good. But we, are another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purſe-bearers, we geue the goods of our God, &amp; we geue them to ſuch as are not onely able to pay vs againe, but alſo to lend vs as much when we ſtand in need. And although they ſhould be vnable to pay, yet God, by whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement we geue them, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs the ſame for them, and maketh it his owne debt, and chargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo not only to pay the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, but to geue vſury for it, yea double, treble, and an hundreth fold. And we are beſides to conſider, that all theſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132013:36"/> benefits ſhould be dealt proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, for our neceſſities, and that by the lawe of nature, they belong not vnto vs, no further then wee haue neede of them for the maintenance of our life. The meaſure of our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are heate, cold, hunger, and thirſt: and if the cuſtome of the countrey wherein we liue, and faſhions of our countreymen, induce vs to any neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fineneſſe, we muſt not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too too auſterely refuſe it, neyther yet ouercuriouſly affect the ſame. Wherein, wee are firſt to regard in what ſtate and degree of honor God hath placed vs amongſt our brethren, and which is ſortable vnto the eſtate whereunto we are borne or called, to the end wee might appropriat our goods vnto our ſelues, and not our ſelues vnto our goods. Now, when we haue furniſhed our ſelues with aſmuch as is needfull for our eſtate, we muſt lay the reſt by, and be very watchfull in the well beſtowing therof. And that which may ſerue to direct vs thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is to take away the merite and the neceſſitie of ſuch as we would beſtow the ſame on: for, it is the equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132013:36"/> &amp; meaſure, which chiefly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the deede holy and pleaſing vnto God, who hath diſpoſed all things by meaſure, &amp; hath geuen vnto vs reaſon as a compaſſe, to make all our actions iuſt &amp; euen like vnto his. For if I geue my goods vnto him that hath no need, and ſee a poore man dye at my feet for want of food, this is an indiſcreet libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie in the rich, &amp; manſlaughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poore man. If I for the helping of a ſtranger, let my father and mother want, the order of true &amp; naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is peruerted, and mine action is diſgraced. We are alſo to obſerue the things by which we mean to place our good deeds, and ſome be more vrgent then otherſome: for, we may doubt of ſome of them, in our geuing, &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may pluck the good deed into our own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: howbeit we are prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally to take heed, that we geue not away that which is another mans: for, they that take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one man to geue to another, are abhominable before God, and their almes &amp; off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132013:37"/> offereth vnto God the fruite of his iniquitie, that offering is moſt foule and filthie.</hi> We ſhould make a great accoumpt of this vertue, to frame and faſhion it very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſound in our minds, as being full of all ſpirituall grace, that might greatly further vs vnto our ſaluation, when as it ſhall accuſtome vs, liberally to diſtribute our goods to thoſe that haue need of them, and our almes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his honor which hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs them. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was not afeard to ſay, that almes is another Baptiſme: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that as water putteth out the fier, euen ſo doth almes kill ſinne. This almes (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth) is Gods friend, which obtayneth at his hands whatſoeuer ſhe craueth: ſhe ſetteth priſoners at libertie, calleth home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoſe that are baniſhed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth pardon for the condemned. For, the hand of the poore, is Gods purſe. Haue wee any thing to buy of him? let vs then geue him our money. And the beſt way for vs to beſtow our goods, is to put them into Gods banke, for he will aſſure it vs not only on the land and the whole continent thereof, which is his, but alſo in heauen, and in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:132013:37"/> eternall bliſſe, wherewith he will ſeaſe; and inueſt vs. Why ſhould we then be ſo fooliſh as to ſuffer our gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to ruſt in our cheſts, and ſo, alwaies blindfold our minds, with laying vp crowne by crowne, ſeeing we ſuffer the time to paſſe for the doing of our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and that all which we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſcrape together, is nothing but toyle vpon toyle heaped vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Surely, all theſe goods which bring with them nothing elſe but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe with their only aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in which are neuer fulneſſe nor yet meaſure, are nothing elſe but a cage of gold, and a priſon of ſiluer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their maiſters, to hold them faſt bound to the vpper part of the earth, &amp; thereby bereaue them of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for going vnto heauen. This is the water that is powred vpon the Egles wings, becauſe he ſhould not flye vp vnto the Sunne. Euen ſo muſt they that will taſte of the fruite of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and attaine vnto perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, where the courſe of our ſoule muſt reſt, take heed that they hinder not them ſelues, but as little as they can in the dirty dunghill of riches,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:132013:38"/> which are no better then very clay and earth, what great accompt ſoeuer they make of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet notwithſtanding it is for this duſt that we kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is it which we ſet both our ſouls &amp; bodies on the teinters for. For this, great and mightie cities band the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues one againſt another in arms &amp; battel: this, is the very plague of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſocietie: this, is the water of ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which parteth brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſunder, yea which ſeperateth the father from the child. And therefore we had need ſet a fourth &amp; the laſt bar betwixt vs &amp; our affections, to keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſiring that which is another mans, &amp; to teach vs to geue to euery one that which is his owne. And this vertue, we call <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> wherof if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider in generall, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth within her ſelf al ſorts of vertues: and her office, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> teacheth vs, is firſt to ioyne men together with God, ſecondly, to reconcile one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another, which are two things verie neerely knit together. For, if the firſt keepe vs within that duty wherin God hath created vs, which is, to feare, loue, and ſerue him, and do good vnto our neighbour, it cannot be but that we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:132013:38"/> muſt ſtand in the grace and fauour both of God and men. Or if we will more particularly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and wherein ſhe diſpoſeth vs to liue iuſtly and lawfully with men, her action may very fitly be deuided into three parts or heads. The firſt is, to liue honeſtly, without breaking the lawes either of God, or of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The other is, not to offend any man, either in word or deed. The third is, to geue vnto euery man that which is his owne. Now, if as much ſhould be ſpoken of this argument as might be, we ſhould exceed that meaſue that I haue preſcribed and ſet downe for this ſmall treatiſe. And therefore it ſhall ſuffice that we ſpeake of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing which is recommended vnto vs by <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which is, to keepe our faith in all our doings, to take in hand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing craftily &amp; cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly, but to deale plainly &amp; openly in all our affaires. For ouer &amp; beſides, that faith is the knot &amp; common band of the amitie &amp; ſocietie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo alſo is it vnto vs as gage, of the grace of God which he hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vs, to communicate himſelf with vs. And ſeeing that by this &amp; the ſelf ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132013:39"/> word, is ſignified vnto vs the aſſurance which we haue of our ſaluation, and conſtancy of our promiſe, we are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeue, that whoſoeuer ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this pawne amongſt men, will lightly abuſe that gage which God hath geuen him. And in very deede, whoſoeuer he is that ſhall ſet before his eyes the lawe of God, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which therein is denounced, and the paines that are prepared for the wicked, is it poſſible that that man will euer haue the heart to deceiue him, whome the lawe hath commaunded to loue as him ſelfe? will he, by defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his neighbour, deceiue his owne ſoule of that euerlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereof thoſe men can neuer be partakers, who communicate with the father of lying, and of lyes? For, truth commeth from heauen, &amp; falſhood, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And therefore all our actions ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:132013:39"/> be ſincere and faithfull, but eſpecially their actions who are in authoritie to gouerne the people, and are put in truſt to render iuſtice vnto euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man. They muſt not do as the Egiptian Iudges did, that ware the image of Iuſtice about their necks, but they muſt haue it imprinted in the bottome of their hearts, and betweene their lips, for ſhe alone it is that muſt direct their iudgements, ſo as neither loue nor hatred, muſt at any hand make the ballance or ſcales which they hold in their hands, leane either one way or other, but reaſon alone muſt cauſe the lawe ſpurne and kick againſt iniquitie. Surely, no man can haue a better teſtimonie vnto his conſcience of his election, then when as he fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:132013:41"/> her ſelf vnto her reſting place. Now, as we are caſt downe into the darkeneſſe of this world, into the deſerts of ſin, &amp; bottomleſſe deapths of perdition, we cannot ſee our end without light, not find our way without a guide, ne yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine our ſelues &amp; go forward without ſtay: and our light, guide, and ſtay is, the reuelation which God hath ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs out of his will, the knowledge which he hath geuen vnto vs by his grace, the ſpirit, by which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth himſelf with vs, and in the end commeth himſelfe vnto vs, becauſe we are ſo feeble, as that we cannot go vnto him. We call faith the ſound and right affection, whereby wee receiue that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he declareth vnto vs, and which we conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beleeue, and by which, we iudge of him in the goodnes &amp; ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of our harts.

Now, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as our ſoule hath
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:132013:41"/> once found her ſelf diſpoſed to belieue this, and receiued this impreſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, ſhe then cleerly ſeeth the marke whereat ſhe aimeth, &amp; kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing thereby the benefit which is ſet before her, ſhe is touched with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effectual feeling of pleaſure, which eggeth her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually forward to wiſh &amp; looke for the ſaluation which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her. This is that hope by the which ſhe foreſeeth the happy hour of her felicitie, by which ſhe is kept for the loking for her bleſſednes, &amp; vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; double ſtrengthened againſt all the griefes and miſeries which might ſhake the ſame, and croſſe her in the way. Here then wee ſee how we muſt prepare our ſoule to make it capable of this felicitie. We muſt now then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſee &amp; behold by her dealing, how ſhe delighteth her ſelf in this moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pleaſure.

In very deed I ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to cauſe you to haue a deſire to write hereof that, which I my ſelfe day
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:132013:52"/> and night, do here in this wilderneſſe. For although I haue left the city, &amp; all thoſe tedious dealings which brought vnto me with them a thouſand miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, and a thouſand diſcommode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet can I not poſſibly leaue my ſelfe, but am euen properly moſt like vnto them that being not wonted vnto the ſea, grow ſo ſick when they are a ſhip-borde: &amp; thinking thegreatneſſe of the veſſell, and rolling thereof, to be the cauſe of their ſickneſſe, are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to go downe into the cockboate for the eaſing and bettering of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and when they are there, they grow ſicker then they were before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they carie with them both their ſtomach and choller alſo into it. And after that manner fareth it alſo with me, for I carrying with my ſelfe, both my priuate and particular paſſions, am continually in the very ſelfe ſame trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnquietneſſe that I was before, and ſo I haue gotten nothing by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing my ſelfe from the world. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, whoſoeuer he be that would do that that ſhould further his ſaluation, and follow the way of him which ſaith; <hi>If any man will follow me, let him forſake
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:132013:52"/> himſelf, and take vp his croſſe and follow me, the ſame man without doubt ſhall finde rest vnto his ſoule.</hi> For as the eye which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mooueth, and rolleth it ſelfe hither and thither, ſometime high and ſometime lowe, can neuer looke ſtraite vpon any thing, and therefore if he will looke well, he muſt ſtedfaſtly caſt and fixe his eye altogether vpon one point: euen ſo, mans vnderſtanding being drawne away with a thouſand ſundrie cares, cannot well bend it ſelfe aright vnto the knowledge of the truth: for the vnmaried man ſhall be carried away with foule and beaſtly deſires and luſts, troubled with fooliſh and furious loue toyes, &amp; other vnbrideled deſires. And on the otherſide, with how many cares ſhal the maried ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be thwarted, for if he hath no children, that will be a great corſiue to him: he muſt alſo haue an eye ynto his wife, he muſt prouide for the necesſaries of his houſe, he muſt be at charges with his ſeruants, he ſhalbe at variance with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, he ſhall always be at ſute in the law, his marchandize ſhall be in hazard, and the manuring and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his grounds will be a great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:132013:53"/> paine and charge vnto him, he ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day haue new troubles in his minde, and the night which bringeth with it all the cares of the day forepaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will toſſe vp and downe in his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie. And there is but one onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for all this, which is, wholy to forſake the world: neither muſt he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his bodie onely from the world, but he muſt with a ſweet and an aſſured reſolution, ſeparate his minde cleane from the world, yea he muſt as it were, violently pluck away his very cogitations from it, and make them flie, haue nothing proper vnto himſelfe, keepe no company, he muſt be poore and without ſubſtance, and without all worldly dealings, farre from any negociations, ignorant of politike ſciences and trades, and onely prepare himſelfe to receiue into his ſoule, the inſtructions of holy wiſdom. And we cannot better prepare our ſelues herevnto, then to forget wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conditions, and naughtie dealing, wherein we were heretofore brought vp in and inſtructed, for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write any thing vpon a written paire of tables, except we firſt wipe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:132013:53"/> that out-which before was written; Euen ſo likewiſe it is impoſſible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue in the heart of men, the will and word of God, if ye firſt of all pluck not out thereof the fore conceiued opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which before haue beene therein imprinted by a wicked kinde of life. And hereunto the ſolitarie life is wonderfull profitable, becauſe that it ouercommeth all our perturbations, and giueth reaſon, time and leiſure, to draw them out of the ſoule. For as wilde beaſts are eaſily tamed when as they are made much of, and dealt gently withall; euen ſo our luſts, chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, terrors and ſorrowes, which are the very poiſons of our ſoules, are with greater eaſe ruled and gouerned by reaſon, when as they begin to quiet themſelues, and are not prouoked and made ſauage by a continuall cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore ſuch a place muſt be choſen out as this which we are in, out of all company, to the end our continuall meditation be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any reſort, for this godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation nouriſheth the ſoule with ſweet and heauenly cogitations, and what a more bleſſed thing can there be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:132013:54"/> then to imitate here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth die life and accord of Angels? And to be vp by the ſunnering, to pray &amp; ſing himnes and ſongs vnto the creator, and when the ſunne is at the higheſt, to begin his labour againe, and licor and ſeaſon his trauaile in the ſalt of deuout prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſpirituall ſongs? For there is nothing that ſo much gladdeth the minde, and maketh it more merie and ſtrong, then the conſolation of holy ſongs: and therefore quiet reſt is the very right preparatiue for the purging and clenſing of the ſoule. For, becauſe the tongue is not then impeached for the diſcouering of the affaires of the world, neither are the eyes yet occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about the iudging of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diuerſity of colours, or of the proportion of bodies, neither doth the hearing ſpend and waſte the forces of the vnderſtanding, to heare pleaſant ſongs, which are made to tickle the eares, or yet matter of laughter, foolery and knauery, which ſerue for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe but to weaken the force and intention of the mind. Now when the ſoule is not caried away with thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of outward things, &amp; ſpred abroad
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:132013:54"/> as it were by the ſences vpon worldly things, ſhe commeth back vnto her ſelf and returnerh wholy into her ſelfe, and afterward of her ſelfe raifeth vp her ſelf euen vnto God. Then all the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and brightneſſe of this diuine moſt bright ſhining light, forgerteth all her naturall actions, &amp; careth no more for food and clothing, no ſhe not ſo much as once thinketh of any earthly thing, but tranſferreth all her ſtudy for the getting of eternall benefits. She addicteth her ſelfe, and ſtudieth how ſhe may become temperate, how ſhe may frame her actions according to righteouſneſſe and prudence, how ſhe may become couragious, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, all other vertues which deuout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons learne, to addreſſe al their actions vnto comlineſſe and perfection of life. The plaine beaten high way that muſt bring vs hereunto, and keepe vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of our duty, is the reading and meditating of the holy ſcriptures, for therein we ſhall finde the moſt vertuous and excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to cauſe vs to do well, that poſſiblie may be, and examples and hiſtories of the liues of holy and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:132013:55"/> religious perſons, which are ſo many liuely images, and exemplars of all good manners, and holy conuerſation, which are there ſet before vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Wherefore, whoſoeuer he be that ſhall feele any infirmitie in him ſelfe, and ſtaieth himſelfe hereon, ſhall finde therein as in a ritch and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Apothecaries ſhop, euery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie drugge that is fit to recouer his heal, for let him that loueth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and modeſtie, read oner or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the hiſtorie of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and therein he ſhall learne actions full of great continencie and chaſtitie, and finde that he was not onely chaſte and a reſiſter of filthie luſt, but by reaſon of long exerciſe, confirmed alſo in all ſorts of ventues, he ſhall likewiſe learne by <hi>Iob</hi> a rare couragious minde, in ſeeing the aduerſities which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, as being become from a great riche man, to be a moſt miſerable poore wretch, and from a father of a noble and great familie; a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and without children, ſtanding couragiouſlie and coutinually vnto his tackling, his mightie conſtancie being neuer abated, nor his heart any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:132013:55"/> whit at all leſſened. And when his friends which came to comfort him, had prouoked him, and fell a ieſting at him for his talke, and ſtirring his mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet could they neuer thereby driue him into choller. But if any man would dreame, with what magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie he could be able to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe courteous and gentle, and being angrie againſt ſinne, loue and make much of the perſons that offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he ſhall finde <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was a moſt braue and valiant expert man of warre, to be notwithſtanding ſuch a one, as was farre from reuenging himſelfe of his enemies. Such a one was alſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he would be mightely angrie againſt thoſe that blaſphemed the honour of God: but vnto ſuch as offended and ſlaundered himſelfe, he would be merueilous calme and gentle. And therefore we muſt do as good Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Counterfeiters do, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon them to draw out the counterfeit of ſome man or beaſt, or any other thing elſe curiouſly wrought in a table before their faces, looking oftentimes vpon the thing which they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:132013:56"/> are counterfeiting, do draw the linia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one after another, vntill they haue finiſhed and ended their worke that is to ſay, looking vpon the liues of holy men, as vpon liuely images, draw out of them the moſt excellent linia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vertue, to make vs perfect, and to make ours by imitation, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in all goodneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. So we returning from labour vnto praiers, ſhall by them make our minds and ſpirits more liuely and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as heated and enflamed with a true godly loue. For a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praier engendreth in our ſoules, a manifeſt knowledge of the goodneſſe of God: for that maketh God, as it were, to dwell in vs, as hauing ſetled him deepely in our remembrances, and ſo by this means we are made the temples of God, when as the intent of our minde is not interrupted by any earthly cogitations, nor our ſoule troubled with any ſuddaine motions, but flying and eſchewing all other thing, retireth her ſelfe towards God as to her friend, and driuing away all peruerſe affections which mooue vs vnto intemperance; giueth her ſelfe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:132013:56"/> wholy vnto the ſtudie of thoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which lead her vnto vertue. And firſt it is very meet we take heed, that we ſpeake nothing impertinently to the purpoſe, but to finde out things after a gentle manner, and without contention, and to anſwer vnto that which is demaunded without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not interrupt him that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the purpoſe, of any thing, and to keepe ſuch a moderation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, as that it might not ſeeme that he meant by any vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to thwart the matter at that time ſet a broche. Neither muſt any man be aſhamed to learne, or yet hide that which hath beene taught him by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: dealing like vnto wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that robbe other women of their children, and make their husbands beleeue that they are theirs. But we muſt giue vnto him that hath taught vs, all the honour and glory. It is beſt, as I thinke, that euery man ſpeake moderately and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, ſo as his wordes be not loſt before they come vnto the eare, neither yet muſt they bee ouer lowde, nor raſhlie ſpoken, nor yet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:132013:57"/> vnaduiſedly, for a man muſt firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with himſelfe, what he will ſay, and then afterward vtter it, carie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gratiouſly in reaſoning, and to giue a good liking in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, not with meriments, but with beneuolence, gratious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, &amp; naturall courteſie, alwaies flying and auoiding, when there is any need of reproouing, all bitterneſſe, and eger words. He muſt firſt frame himſelfe to be of an humble and meeke ſpirit, that he might like and pleaſe him who hath need of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. The manner which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vſed in reproouing of <hi>Dauid,</hi> is very many times good and profitable for vs, who would not by and by, and vpon the ſudden, accuſe him of the ſoule fact which he had committed, but told him of his fault vnder the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of another, whereby he made him the iudge of his owne ſinne, ſo as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing condemned himſelfe, he could by no means take any occaſion to fall out with him that had reproued him. Now he that is humble and caſt downe in his cogitations, looketh alwaies down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, weareth his apparell careleſlie,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:132013:57"/> his haire long, and his garment not made after the faſhion, ſo as that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militia that mourners faſhion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto, is naturall in him. His Gowne muſt be girt vnto him, but not aboue his loynes, for that is ſomewhat womaniſh: neither yet too looſe, for that bewrayeth his ſlothfulneſſe. His gate muſt not be ſlow, becauſe it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a ſoft ſpirit, ne yet ouer-haſtie, for feare he be noted to be haggar hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The garments are made but for one thing, which is, to keepe the fleſh from heat and cold. He muſt not hunt after colours, to pleaſe the eye, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit faſhions for delicacies ſake: for, they that hunt after theſe ſorts of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, are womaniſh, who beautify their ſmooth well coloured cheeks and their haire, with many ſtrange and diuers coloured paintings. The Gowne muſt be made of ſuch ſtuffe, as that we ſhall not need to caſt another vpon it, to kepe vs from the cold. His hoſing muſt be of a ſmall price, but yet of ſuch a price, as may ſuffice the neceſſitie for which he vſeth it. And generally, as in his garments, ſo muſt he alſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things haue regard vnto frugalitie

He may vſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads of herbs as farre as is neceſſarie to ſtrengthen and brawne the bodie, He muſt not at his meales eate raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly like an hungerſtarued Wolfe, but ſhew himſelfe alwayes like vnto himſelfe, ſober, and temperate in all his deſires: neither muſt he in the meane while occupie his minde in playing the foole, but dreaming of the nature of things wherewith we are nouriſhed, take occaſion to glorifie God, who gouerneth and moderated all things, for ſo much as he hath deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed and brought forth ſo many ſundry ſorts of meates, which by a ſingular propertie are applied vnto the vſe and maintenance of our bodyes. And therefore before we go to meate, we muſt gene God thanks for that which he hath beſtowed vpon vs, and beſeech him to beſtowe vppon vs in time to come, that which he hath promiſed vs. We muſt haue but one houre in the day for our meales, and that muſt be alſo obſerued in good order, ſo as in the xxiiij. houres of the day and night,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:132013:58"/> we muſt beſtow this one houre about our body, and all the reſt of the time muſt be ſpent in ſpirituall exerciſes. We muſt make but ſhort ſleepes, that we may wake quickly, and our ſleepe muſt be after the manner of our life, which is oftentimes interrupted by great and earneſt cogitations. For to be tyed to a deepe ſleepe, as if all our members were benummed, and by ſuch reſt to gene place vnto dreames, and fooliſh imaginations, is to dye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Their morning, which make a deuout profeſſion, is midnight, for then do they take their time to prayſe God, becauſe that when as the reſt of the night turneth away their hearts from whatſoeuer might occupie their eyes &amp; eares, it keepeth their thoughts fixed on God, geueth them the means to amend their conſiences by recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their ſinnes, and to ſet barres vnto their ſoules to keepe them from euill, and to implore the goodnes of God, that it might worke together in them this perfection of life which they hope to aſpire and come vnto.</p>

When <hi>Solon</hi> was asked whether he had geuen vnto the <hi>Athenians</hi> the beſt lawes he could, he anſwered no, but I haue geuen them the beſt that they are able to abide. And we muſt apply remedies according to the ſtrength &amp; nature of the diſeaſed. To be ſhort, we are not warranted in our affaires none otherwiſe then with our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and hauing done the beſt we can, becauſe it is to be done, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diſcharged both before God &amp; men. And as for the particular iniuries which we receiue therby, where ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we better beſtow our charitie &amp; patience? where ſhall we exerciſe that which we learne out of the ſchoole of Chriſt, if we can not beare the iniuries &amp; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people with whome wee liue? yea, when ſhall we hope that by our patience wee ſhall appeaſe the popular furies, bring agayne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people into their right wits,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:132013:65"/> diſplace the wicked from their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and ſet good men in their rooms? It is moſt certaine, that theſe diſeaſes are ſooner cured by winning of time, then by applying of remedies, it is far better to entertaine them by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they empaire not, for in the end, it is length of time that muſt ripen and heale them. For, the people by experience recouer health, and then they ſeeke after good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, and abhorre thoſe whome before they had made much of. They are like vnto pale-coulored maydes, which eate all the worſt things that poſſibly they can get, but they caſt them by and by vp againe. For, ſo ſoone as they are ſtirred and moued, they vſe for the ſeruing of their turne the moſt deſperate and moſt wicked men: but they are no ſooner quieted and in a good moode, and that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate boyling heate hath runne ouer, they by and by make no accompt of thoſe villaines, but are the firſt that will lay hold on them and plague them. And therefore is not the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale greatly benefited, when as good men preſerue them ſelues for ſuch a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:132013:65"/> dangerous time, and forſake not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through anger, or deſpaire, the ſhip wherein they ſee the drunken paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers for a time rage and ſtorme? I confeſſe in deed, that he muſt needs in ſuch a caſe runne into a thouſand hazards, and ſuffer a thouſand indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. But whoſoeuer taketh the paine, to him belongeth the merite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and through trauell, glorie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth. But eſpecially amongſt vs Chriſtians, who make profeſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and abide by it, and haue enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our ſelues vnder a Captaine, that layeth before our eyes an hard and tedious warfare, and aſſigneth vnto vs no crowne, before ſuch time as we haue ſuſtayned many ſtrange afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and innumerable trials and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. He braggeth no whit of his victories, ne yet of his ſouldiers that haue followed him, otherwiſe then for their patience. By this only vertue haue they conquered ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, Kingdomes, and Empires, and were no way glorious, but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and bearing of iniuries. How can we then better follow him, then by hazards, opprobries, and iniuries?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:132013:66"/> And in what a more worthie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable occaſion can we endure all this, then to ſerue, for the good and preſeruation of our countrey? If loue, which God hath ſo highly commended vnto vs, may ſo preuaile with vs, as to hazard our goods and liues for the ſafetie of our neighbour, what ought we to do for ſuch an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number of men, and ſuch a number of cities and prouinces, vnto which nature hath conioyned and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed vs by all one lawe, language, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſecret affection, which ſhe hath imprinted in vs, from the which, whoſoeuer ſeparateth himſelfe, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged of all the nations of the world vnworthie to behold the day light, and to liue and be eſteemed amongſt men as an vnnaturall and cruell Parricide. Now, God came not into the world to diſſolue and adnihilate this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obligation, but contrarywiſe, more ſurely to ſtrayne and tye the knot by this loue, which he hath ſo greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs. Euen ſo we alſo ſee, that when we once begin to cut aſunder the bond of the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto our countrey, that all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:132013:66"/> manner not onely of diſorders, but of moſt abhominable crimes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes ſet in foote; and thefts, murders, rapes, extortions, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, forthwith rule and reigne. Now, what is it in the whole world, which a man can more miſlike, more abhorre, kindle his furie more, and more ſtirre and prouoke him to ruyne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found people? What ſhall wee then ſay? whileſt ſo many labour headlong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ouerthrow both them ſelues and their countrey, will you, euen you, I ſay, that haue alwayes had charge, and whoſe office bindeth you to take paines for the common weale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne as it were careleſly in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, to ſee, your ſelfe being ſafe, the fire burne your countrey, and reſerue your ſelfe to behold the aſhes thereof? What a grief would it be vnto you, not to haue brought the ayde which you might haue done, or at leaſt not to haue made an aſſay &amp; proofe thereof? Do you not dayly ſee, that after our frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are dead, we ſay euen with ſighs, if we had done ſuch a thing, it may he that he had bene aliue? Come therefore, and contribute with vs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:132013:67"/> your wiſedome, and reſolute coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that we may ſaue that which in this world is moſt deare vnto vs. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare this purpoſe of yours to liue a ſolitarie life, and drawe you vnto your reſt, euen then when wee ſhall all at once haue brought the Ship to the hauen, or elſe being ouercome with that fooliſh opinion of ſuch as would willingly caſt away them ſelues, be ſaued with ſome boord of the wracke. But if we periſh therein, death, which way ſoeuer he may come, ſhall haue ſhewed vs no ſmall fauour, in taking vs away from the beholding of ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a ſpectacle or ſight.</p>

The graue, yea ſurely the graue, which is the happieſt thing that can betide me, if ſo be ſo ſmall a pit may be able to ſtay the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſe of mine extreame miſery.</p>

And now that I haue dried vp all my teares, the bloud will guſh out of mine eyes, for feare I ſhould be voide of teares in ſo lamentable and curſed a caſe. But the Pellican hath redeemed with her own bloud, the price of her yong ones, and I moſt miſerable wretch that I am, ſhall be depriued for euer of the child which I ſo tenderly loued. And I will

                     <p n="8">8 I am continually kept waking, ſtill dreaming of my miſerie, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to hide my ſelfe before ſuch time as the in felicitie which runneth vpon me, enforceth me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mated and out of heart, I ſeeke after ſome corner to hide my ſelfe in, euen as the wilde ſparrow that flieth out of the raine and winde, ſeeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome couert or ſunne ſhine place to bathe and drie her ſelfe in.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Mine enemies ſeeing me in this caſe, and with ſuch a countenance, ſtand mocking of me therewith, and caſt my miſerie in my teeth: and they which were wont to make a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of me, in ſtead of ſorrowing with me in mine afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt me.

And ſhall I for all this become a laughing ſtock vnto this infidelous generation?</p>
                     <p n="11">11 It is very true, that I haue bene met withall before thy face, in the day of thy wrath: thou haſt laid againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, the arme of thy vengeance, and am become therewith fruſhed in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Men haue had me in great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and honour, and loe how I am now dreſt and dealt withall. O vaine preſumption, vnto what ſteepe break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck haſt thou lifted me vp, to make me leape ſuch a leape? Alas, what did I finde in my ſelfe, why I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in mine heart ſuch an opinion of my ſelfe?</p>
                     <p n="12">12 As we ſee the ſhadow of the body by little and little decreaſe, when as the ſunne is riſen aboue the ſame, and reduceth it, as it were vnto

                     <p n="13">13 But do I for all this loſe my hope? No, no, my God: for thy power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and laſteth for euer, and thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie immeaſurable, which will ſpred it ſelfe ouer all ſuch as ſhall truſt in thee. One age ſhall paſſe after another, but the remembrance of thy goodneſſe ſhall neuer haue end: one generation ſhall ſucceed another, but it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for the ſetting forth of thy praiſe and good dealing.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 Thou wilt one day, my God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken, to haue mercie vpon <hi>Sion,</hi> for the time of mercie draweth neare. And loe, I ſee it euen at hand. The flouds and riuers powre not out ſo much clears water into the deepe ſea,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:132013:95"/> as thy goodneſſe will ſpred abroad thy fauour and grace vpon the face of this earth. Open your hearts, yee people, open your hearts, I ſay, for the liberall hand of my God, will fill them with an holy zeale, which will make thee farre purer and cleaner then the gold in the fining pot.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 Now the houſe of <hi>Sion,</hi> O Lord, is the refuge which all thy ſeruants looke for, it is it which they ſo greatly loue, and which they ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it is it where they looke to finde mercy; it is the temple, O Lord, which thou wilt deſtroy in three daies, and raiſe it vp againe mother three, that it may be the houſe of euerlaſting life, the ſeat of ſaluation, the treaſure of grace, and temple of eternitie.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Then ſhall all the nations, my God, be afraide, and all the kings of the earth tremble at the brightneſſe of thy glorie. What corner of the world ſhall be ſo ſecret, where the noiſe of thy bleſſed comming ſhall not ſound and be heard? where ſhall that people be ſo farre from the ſunne, ſo confined and limitted in darkneſſe, as will not vnſeele their eyes to behold the cleare

Yea heauen it ſelfe ſhall encreaſe his flames, to giue light vnto this thine entrance into the world, and the kings ſhall run from all places to do homage vnto the king of kings, vnto the gouernor both of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 For he hath ſet vp and aduanced his kingly throne vpon <hi>Sion,</hi> in great &amp; coſtly array: there ſhall he be ſeene wholy encompaſſed with glory, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sunne and Moone with the brightneſſe of his face.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 But why haſt thou, O Lord, ſo highly exalted the throne of thy glory? haſt thou done it, becauſe thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not vouchſafe to heare the praiers of thy faithfull ſeruants? And becauſe thou wouldeſt make no reckoning of the whole world, which in deed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in reſpect of thy greatneſſe? Alas no my God. Thou haſt lifted vp thy ſelf vpon an eminent place, that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth might ſee &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee, and ſo run vnto thy grace and mercy: for thou ſhouldeſt be alwaies ready to come at the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſummons of thy ſeruants, &amp; neuer

And behold them alſo ſtanding as miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offenders, condemned vnto bolts &amp; ſhackles, looking for the comming of ſome king, that ſhould ſet them free at the entrance into his kingdome. Euen ſo, ô Lord, deliuer thou them who haue giuen themſelues vp into the bondage of ſinne, and with the onely twinke of thine eye, the mainacles ſhall fall from their wriſtes.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 Then ſhall they be all heard to ſing a glorious ſong vnto the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous king, their voices ſhall be heard throughout al the corners of the earth, and the remembrance of thy ſingular bountie and infinite mercy, ſhall be engraued within the memory of men, and ſo paſſe from age to age, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the laſt poſteritie. The earth ſhall then be conſumed, all the waters dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, the ayre vaniſhed, and the heauens haue an end, which ſhall as yet ſing the glory of the eternall God.</p>

But the God of life hath ouercome death, and hath freed and cleared them quite from thence.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 To the end, O Lord, that they might ſet foorth thy praiſe in <hi>Sion,</hi> and preach thy louing kindneſſe in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> And although euery one of them had an hundreth mouthes, and their voices as lowd as thy thunder, yet ſhould they neuer be able to attaine and reach vnto the greatneſſe of thy glory. All the parts of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire not, nor ioyne not themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaue onely to repreſent in their motions, a part of thine infinite power and goodneſſe: howbeit, they neuer looke to come neere thereunto; for they are more then bottomleſſe depths, which haue neither bottom

                     <p n="22">22 And therefore I moſt humbly beſeech thee my God, to be contented that thy people aſſemble and reunite themſelues both in bodies and minds, deuoutly to offer vp vnto thee that holy will which they haue to honour thee, for the effect can in no wiſe other wiſe be able to come neare that which thou deſerueſt. Accept therefore, O Lord, the humble ſubmiſſion of the kings of the earth, which come before thee to yeeld vnto thee their homage and ſeruice due vnto thee, as vnto their ſoueraigne &amp; chiefe Lord. They ſhall caſt their ſcepters vnto the earth, and their crownes at their feete, and preſent for a ſacrifice vnto thy maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty their humble praiers, and innocent conſciences. And I will be the firſt my God, which will caſt downe my ſelfe before thee, to worſhip and ſerue thee with all mine heart, to thee alone will I conſecrate my ſpirit. Quicken it therefore, O Lord, that being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the holy zeale of thy loue, it may receiue in it ſelfe, as it were in a cleare looking Glaſſe, the image of

But alas, as I looke vnto the world, and thinke with an innocent life, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe amongſt men, I ſee their enuie turned vpon me, and all their purpoſes &amp; drifts directed to do me hurt. So as I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:132013:109"/> ſtand in doubt whether I be reconciled vnto thee or no, and whether thou be ſatisfied with this my repentance. But in turning mine eyes euery way, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that this affliction is common to me, and to all honeſt and good men, by the parts that I ſee playd them on euery ſide, and how their conſtancie is alwayes in danger: and contrarywiſe, to ſee how the wicked eaſily regorge pleaſure, and all maner of benefits, maketh me confounded and aſtonied. For, on the one ſide, I call to mind that thou art the great and mightie God of Iuſtice, whoſe eye ſeeing all things, knoweth the deepeſt &amp; ſecreteſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and whoſe almightie hand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto the fartheſt parts of the world. And on the other ſide, I ſee thoſe that lift vp their heads againſt thee, and oppreſſe thy poore and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſeruants, proſper in thy ſight, and dayly pride vp them-ſelues in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſucceſſe of their vngodlynes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ô Lord, that I ſtand like a block, and as one being blindfolded with this ſight, am not able to pierce through theſe thick miſts, which thus enuiron the eyes of mine vnderſtanding. But
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:132013:109"/> in the end, ô Father of lights, thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeledſt mine eye-lids, and enlightning me with the beames of thy wiſedome, haſt made me vnderſtand why thou ſo vſeſt them, and deliuering me from the payne and care wherein I was, haſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me with the aſſurance of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and geuen me a moſt certaine conſolation &amp; comfort. So as I do not only at this preſent care for the thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of threatners, and diſdaine their inſolencie, but being rampard with wonderfull conſtancie, and great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, I offer my ſelfe vnto the combat, and cry with a loud voyce, Come who ſo euer will and dare, for, I now feare nothing. For, although God for a while exerciſeth his faithfull ſeruants, yet forſaketh he them not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſtand in need, but in ſuch ſort compaſſeth their aduerſitie with their forces, as that they become alwayes conquerors in this fight. And to ſay truly, ſo long as I am aſſured of his mercie, what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion can I haue, euer to feare?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He hath now taken my life into his protection, and couered me all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with the wings of his power, who can enforce him to ſet me aſhore?
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:132013:110"/> What ſhall I need to feare, ſeeing that all the world feare and dread him which defendeth me? his forces are not the armies of men, but legions of Angels: his miniſters are not Princes and Captaines, but thundring, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſtormes: his wrath is not blowes and hurts, but earthquakes, ſwallowing vp of Cities, and drowning of whole Countreys. Thou haſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ô Lord, all theſe armyes and hoſts in thine hand, and art readie to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them againſt the proude bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wicked, that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured the ruyne of good men. But becauſe my God thou holdeſt back for a time the arme of thy diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, comfort mee in the meane while with a ſure hope, that thou wilt neuer forſake mee: And mee thinketh, that thou ſayeſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie vnto mee, tarrie a little, for, the time is not yet come which I haue appointed, and in the meane while, truſt thou aſſuredly vnto my promiſe, and looke whatſoeuer affliction thou ſhalt endure, be thou aſſured that I will geue thee ſtrength to ouercome it. My courage, ô Lord, encreaſeth,

There is nothing now that I am afeard of: for, all theſe conſpiracies, all theſe ſlanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports againſt mine head &amp; honor, ſeme to me like vnto the ſoming raging bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of the ſea, who roring far off, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly breake them-ſelues againſt the foot of a rock, and ſcatter them-ſelues abroad at the firſt ſtroke, and the blow is but a vaine ſound, which is the end of all theſe great threats. Certainely, the conſcience of an innocent man, founded and grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy grace, is more ſtable &amp; ſure, then all the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt rocks, &amp; cannot be ſhaken nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by any iniurious brags.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 What ſhall I now feare any more? Shall I feare a rout of the wicked, that goe about to beſet me round, and cluſter about me, to ſee if they could take me?

And therefore, O Lord, I beſeech thee to help me euermore. For, as mine infirmitie ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth commonly againſt me, ſo alſo haue I need to haue continuall help on euery ſide of me. For, if thou keepe thy ſelfe neuer ſo little awhile from me, my ſoule will euen vaniſh away, and ſo will alſo my bodie, if my ſoule be once gone. For thou, O Lord, art farre away more, the ſoule of my ſoule, then my ſoule, is the ſoule of my bodie. I right well knowe that thy Diuine Maieſtie hath a moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie dwelling place in mee, but yet I humblie beſeech thee, diſdaine nor to come into it: for, where thou once entreſt, all magnificence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, and there is alwayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſufficient where thou art. And beſides, O Lord, thou receyueſt no honor by comming to viſit me, but I thy poore ſeruant am honored by thy preſence. Why ſhouldeſt thou leaue the glorious bright Heauens, and bright ſhining Starres, and to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:132013:116"/> come downe heere belowe, to ſeeke for nothing that can bee ſayd to bee honorable? But it is, as I thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wouldeſt haue thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles knowe and vnderſtand, that they ought not to pride vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in theyr magnificence, ſeeing they are thy creatures, and that thou canſt make the moſt vile enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on the earth, as honorable as any one of them. This is it why thou commeſt downe from the heauen of heauens, to haue mercie vppon vs, and hauing the like feeling of our miſeries, thou commeſt to reeſtabliſh vs in our auncient perfection. And becauſe that wee, as much as in vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, haue defaced the image of the Deitie, which thou haddeſt imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs, thou commeſt to recharge and recouer the liniaments of our firſt nature halfe defaced. It is thou then, who as thou waſt our Creator, ſo alſo wilt be our Redeemer, and, as thou haſt beene our Father, ſo alſo wilt be our protector and defender. And it is thou, O Lord, who, although the whole world hath reiected vs, yet haſt ſtretched out thine armes, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:132013:117"/> gathered vs together vnder the wing of thy louing kindneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 And ſo is it moſt meet, for I knowe not whither elſe to goe. My Father and my Mother haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee, I meane, the Father that begot mee, and my Mother that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly nurſed me, and brought me vp, did abhorre mee, when as they ſawe mee ſet my whole hart vpon thee, and leaue the vanities of this world.

                     <p n="18">18 Deliuer me not therefore into their hands, that they may deale with me according to their hearts deſire.

They haue already made ſtrong their part, ſuggeſted a thouſand accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and framed a world of witneſſes, but their leaſings haue returned vpon their owne heads, and borne witneſſe againſt themſelues, for lying cannot be hid, ſhe is full of crackes on euery ſide, &amp; truth pierceth it on euery part. For ſhe is made of many odde peeces, which fall away one from another, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as they are touched, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her ſelfe vnto innocencie, ſhe melteth away as ſnowe againſt the Sunne.</p>

                     <p n="13">13 And therefore, let vs firſt of all, put all lying &amp; deceit farre away from vs, for the true praiſe which God looketh for at our hands, is, that we ſhould i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate him as much as our nature will permit. Now, he is the God of truth and of iuſtice, who can neither loue nor make much of vs, ſo long as lying which is contrary to him, ſhall dwell in vs. Secondarily, we muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſin whatſoeuer: for, to eſchue ill, is the beginning to do well: and alwaies prouided, that if God findeth vs void of wicked intents,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:132013:125"/> he will fill vs with good ones, and teach vs that which we ought to wiſh and procure, and the thing which we ought principalleſt to deſire, he teacheth vs. And that is peace, which he would haue vs deſire with all our hearts. Firſt, peace with him, which is the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of all goodneſſe, which we can neuer haue, except we yeeld him that obedience which we owe him. And then, peace amongſt our ſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which we can neuer haue his For, he hath commanded vs to loue our neighbours as our ſelues, ſo as, if in ſtead of this, we breath out nothing but bloud &amp; ſpoiles, what peace would we haue with him, whoſe lawes and commaundements we infringe and breake? And withall, that warre is no better then the bloſſome of iniuſtice, which is, abhominable before God.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 His eye, which is this well fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and louing eye, beholdeth none but the inſt and righteous: his light, enlighteneth none but them, neither are his miracles ſhewed but in fauour of them, and his eares are not open but vnto their praiers: and we may properly ſay, that his iuſtice is on his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:132013:125"/> ſide, that examineth the life of thoſe which offer themſelues vnto him, and to him recommendeth their praiers which are of an vpright heart.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 And as for thoſe that take pleaſure in ill dooing, he looketh vpon them indeed, but it is with a furious burning eye, whoſe beames are like the arrowes of paines and miſerie, wherewith he woundeth their ſoules, filling them with feare and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides a thouſand other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which he laieth on them, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſts of torments which attend them. He dreameth not of them otherwiſe then of the rooting out of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie from the face of the earth, and by iuſtice to waſh the arrowes of their polution, which are left: for he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently knoweth their impenitent hearts, which haue inſolently neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his holy mercy.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Now, the righteous haue not ſo done, for they haue in good time returned vnto God, and calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his clemencie, haue in the end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, they reioyced therein, and it remained with them, as it were their portion, he hath deliuered them our
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:132013:126"/> of all their troubles wherein they were plunged, and receiued them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his grace, as vnder a braſen wall, ſo as no violent miſchiefe what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, can be able to make them falſe hearted.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 Vndoubtedly, God is maruelous good &amp; fauourable, thou mighteſt ſay, that he is alwaies fauourable vnto the afflicted which call vpon him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh him not day nor night. For no ſooner hath our griefe &amp; ſorrow hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vs, and made vs know what need we haue of him, but that he is by and by ready at hand to ſaue vs.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 In very deed the righteous are afflicted with ſtrange calamities, and a man might properly ſay, that they are the very ſubiect and matter of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to worke on, there are ſo many miſchiefes come tumbling in, one in anothers necke, to oppreſſe them. But this is not to any other end, ſaue to make the mercy of God ſhine more gloriouſly in them. For the greater that the tribulation is, the more doth the pitty and compaſſion ſhine in the preſeruing of them.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 For he keepeth euen the very

And yet more then that, for he hath all their goods, and al their trade &amp; traffick in his protection, and when it pleaſeth him, he will multiply their ſtore, cauſe his bleſſings flouriſh in their houſes, and make their riches and poſſeſſions encreaſe, according to their owne hearts deſire.</p>
                     <p n="20">20 But contrariwiſe, the liues of the wicked ſhall be moſt miſerable.

And what, the very dens of the wilde beaſts were their ſafetie, when any went about to ſet vppon them, and the poore people could neyther finde caue, nor any place of repaire, ſafely to go into. The nature of miſerie is to haue compaſſion on others, but the miſerie of this people, encreaſed the hatred that was borne them. In ſo much as that nature it ſelfe is here

                        <p>Alaſſe, what a fatall ruyne is this, that can not be auoyded?

What would our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie haue more of vs? Why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth it vs when as wee are readie to flye? Doth it afflict vs that are poore wretches? And purſue vs who are baniſhed? Wee are ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade through out all the nations of the world, and ſtray and fleete about, like wracks and vagabonds, we haue all the miſeries that any can poſſibly beate, and yet haue not ſo much as one of the leaſt of their comforts.

Ha, what a thing is this? muſt we who are chaſed into all the corners of the earth, thinke to returne and hide our ſelues vnder the ruynes of our houſes, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue continually our griefes, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hideous deſolation of our Citie?</p>

For, all the nations both whole and ſome, haue come running vnto our feaſts, and to the ſolemnities of our great ſacrifices: but now, we ſee not ſo much as a man once come neere
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:132013:181"/> into this holy Citie. There is not ſo much as an hermitage about it. All the wayes are couered ouer with graſſe, and there is a pretie foreſt of briers &amp; thiſtles about it. Neither can one finde and pick out the footſtep of any man. Theſe beautifull and great gates ſo ritchly &amp; cunningly wrought, which in the ſolemne dayes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with garlands and noſegayes, are now layd all wide open vpon the ground, and broken in fitters. The Centres that layd open the wayes, are now filled and ſtopped vp with their ruynes: Alaſſe, what a change is this? And the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of our Prieſts which went in their <hi>pontificalibus,</hi> ſinging with great maieſtie &amp; reuerence the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our God, are torne and rent in pieces as well as other mens, and do nothing elſe but weepe and groane. They looke vp pitifully with their eyes vnto heauen, to ſee whether the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his wrath would fall vpon them yea or no. The tender Virgines who were wont with their beauty to adorne the face of our City, as the Starres do a moſt glorious and cleare night, are all withered and beſmeared, and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:132013:182"/> nothing but horror and aſtoniſhment in their countenances. For, extreame famine hath dried vp their fleſh, cold hath bereaued them their ruddy and ſmooth checkes, ſorrow and griefe hath wrinkeled their faces, and the flower of their chaſtitie by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier inſolently defaced, hath couered all their faces with ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. And theſe are now no more, but euen ſo many dead, liuing. For, they liue altogether in ſorrow and griefe. Neither is there any thing that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them more to liue; then the ſame dolor, which killeth them with very heauineſſe, and awakeneth them out of their bitterneſſe.</p>

Thou haſt, ô Lord, poured out thy heauie wrath vppon vs, and madeſt vs feele how heauie thy reuengefull hand is. Thou haſt, I beleeue; gathered together all our faults into a bundell once for all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:132013:182"/> that when thou ſaweſt them to be ſo infinite, and worthie the like payne and puniſhment, thou awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt thy ſelfe, and haſt diſcharged the arrowes of thy ſeuere iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. But, ô Lord, oughteſt not thou to ſtay the courſe of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our owne perſons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all thy torments vpon vs? but muſt we alſo be tormented in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our children, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our miſerie the greater, to cauſe vs alſo to ſee theirs? For, wee were ſpoyled of our goods, put out of our houſes, and led away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Wee thought that there was nothing, as it were, to bee feared more then death, and yet now wee feare it not, for, it is ſweet to thoſe that are in miſerie. But our ſpeedie and quicke calamitie, to our great payne and griefe, hath now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken vs with newe miſeries.

                        <p>O Lord, if thou haue any eyes, behold this pitifull ſpectacle, and if thou haue any eares, harken vnto out prayers, and conſider how great
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:132013:199"/> our miſerie is. Behold how thou haſt bene auenged of vs, and ſee what a ſpoyle thou haſt made of vs. And in very deed, I muſt needs confeſſe that we haue deſerued it, and I do proteſt, that we are vnworthie of thy mercy, and do alſo vow, that we our ſelues are the cauſes of our owne miſerie. But what haue theſe poore and wayling children done, whom thou ſeeſt ſcrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out them ſelues, faintly drawing their breath? Why ſhould the child, whom hunger &amp; torment had drawne out, before the time of the mothers womb was ready to deliuer it, which is not as it were ſo great as a mans hand, be rent in pieces by her, which ſhould bring it forth, and ſo be eaten by her, and the ſame to go downe by peece-meale into the body, out of which it came whole and ſound? Surely happy, and twiſe happy, are the Tygres and Lyons whelps in compariſon of theſe, whoſe dammes will aduenture their own liues againſt whatſoeuer violence ſhall be offred their yong ones, rather then they would ſuffer them to take any hurt at all. O Lord, how canſt thou abide this horrible dealing? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:132013:199"/> that thou, which are altogether good &amp; gratious, wouldeſt abide ſuch great impietie to be wrought? that thou, which art ſo wiſe, wouldeſt allow of ſuch a cruell acte? and that thou, which art Almightie, wouldeſt ſuffer ſuch a ſtrange outrage?

Thou haſt not bene pleaſed with the bloud of our ſheepe and oxen alone, but wilt needs alſo haue thine Aulters couered with the bloud of thine owne Prieſts, for they haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their owne liues, and thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets likewiſe haue bene offred vp in oblation, and yet thou art no whit appeaſed.</p>

For, a man ſhall at laſt, finde alwayes pitie and compaſſion in him, if ſo be he will patiently attend his good pleaſure and leyſure. The Sunne neither riſeth nor falleth, but it ſeeth his mercy. His goodnes ſpreddeth it ſelfe ouer all the earth, neyther is there any corner thereof which beareth not his marke. And furthermore, I ſay, that the Sunne ſhineth not but to be ſeene, and to cauſe to ſee. O Lord our God, how great is thy goodnes, how aſſured is thine ayd, how certaine is thy word, and how infallible, thy promiſe? As for my ſelfe, I wil truſt in none but in thee, and if ſo be I may haue thy grace and fauour for my portion, I care for none of the reſt.

                        <p>How can ſhe do better? For, God neuer halted with them which put their truſt in him, for at one time or another, either early or late he hath ſhewed them, that his goodnes is infallible, and that the hart which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, findeth it farre or neere, and that the ſoule which deſireth it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it either ſoone or late.
